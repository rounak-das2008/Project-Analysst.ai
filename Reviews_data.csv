0.0,"The first two books of the series were simply awesome, but this one left me wanting more. Obviously if you read Divergent you wil have to read Allegiant to know what happens to Tris and Tobias, and the ending is very suprising, and on my opinion it was perfect for this story, but there is not much action, kind of monotone.

6.0,"&quot;The Bonesetter's Daughter&quot; is a story rich with a strong, maternal love that I will cherish forever. The spiritual therapy I received from this book with regards to my own mother was absolutely priceless. I often cried and laughed at some of the remarkable similarities of Tan's characters to my own mother and myself. I feel very happy and fortunate for having the oppurtunity to read this beautiful novel.As for the Asian American, Amazon.com reviewers who find Tan's writing too &quot;stereotypical&quot; to Asians, most of these criticisms are usually unjustified banter. I've got four words for those people, &quot;Show me the proof!&quot;. If Tan's writing seems offensive, boring, or predictable to disgruntled reviewers such as &quot;Native Chinese Reader&quot; or &quot;Asian Guy From New York&quot;, they can quit their whining and try reading works by the numerous other famous Asian American literature authors available at Amazon such as: Maxine Hong Kingston (&quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; &amp; &quot;China Men&quot;), Helie Lee (&quot;Still Life With Rice&quot;), Wakako Yamauchi (&quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot;), Chung Rae Lee, etc.",04/17/2001 0:00,"A sincere portayal of strong, maternal love.",5.0

9.0,"Perhaps the main reason for the success of this book is that it implicitly realises that the mystery of the princes in the tower will in all probability never be solved.This means that the author avoids some of the overarching assumptions made by many contributors to the debate, who claim to have found a solution.Fields has clearly recognised the dangers here, and is devastating in his attacks on the astonishingly sloppy piece of work by Alison Weir.He has split his survey of the case into a logical structure and his writing style enables him to cover intricate and complicated arguments without the reading experience becoming over-taxing.Of course for a full overview of the arguments in this case other books should also be read, notably A.J. Pollard, Audrey Williamson, Derek Seward, Charles Ross and Paul Murray Kendall. For a fictional view, The Daughter of Time by Josephine Tey and The Sunnne in Splendour by Sharon Penman are also quite fun.Overall, a thoroughly worthwhile read if you are at all interested in this subject.",04/13/2001 0:00,An entertaining addition to the debate.,3.0

,"As is always the case with the fiction of Lehane, there is some remarkable writing in Live by Night.  The reader follows Joe Coughlin from Boston to Florida as he expands a criminal empire and laments what he believes is a lost love.  The downer for me was the ending, which lacked the payoff of a Lehane novel.  It felt forced, flat, and \token-ized",," but it just didn't hit me like much of his other work.""",
,"For many readers and reviewers thus far, it seems one of Allegiant's mistakes lies in its realism. I'm not bothered by the absolutely brutal realism that Roth gives us in the ending of this book, but I am bothered by the context it's been thrown into... and the places where that realism is abandoned, where the plot loses its sense in an effort to resolve what the author has deemed not worthy of properly solving. With the dual perspectives, we are given dual endings. One half serves as shock value, and what many are referring to as \preachy\"" as Roth hammers in the themes she has stretched over the trilogy. The other half serves as an oversimplified (to the point of being illogical) solution to one of the problems brought up in the series. It almost felt like the one half was intended to be so shocking that Roth expected readers to not realize that the other bit of what was going on really made no sense at all.In Divergent",,which eventually led to the entirety of the book not making much sense,15.0

There were other grammatical slips throughout.That aside, he has done an invaluable public service by thoroughly investigating something the Peace Corps, both of today and of the 1970s, wanted the whole world to forget: when a sex-starved, psychotic volunteer killed another volunteer in 1976 in Tonga, the Corps hushed it up, subverted local justice, and failed to make arrangements to incarcerate the murderer -- freeing him to a long, accomplished career back in his hometown.

,"Garth Nix has really become the premiere young adult author extraordinaire of the dark fantasy novel.  If you are looking for a writer who writes books containing happy unicorns and cute dancing sprites, Nix is not for you.  In this, his first teen novel (amazingly good on that level alone) he creates a world of death, destruction, death, decay, and a little more death.  His heroine constantly walks in the lands of the dead, fights the moral equivalent of zombies left and right, and is gratifyingly competent.  Nix is that rare male author that is just as comfortable penning gruesome fight sequences as he is the intricacies of female menstruation.  If you're looking for a kickin' gal in a wholly original fantasy, \Sabriel\"" is the book to look up.The only daughter of her father",,the Abhorsen is the mage that fights continually to keep the creatures of the dead out of the lands of the living.

,"Fans have been looking forward to this one for a LONG time. A Dance with Dragons completes the story begun six years ago, when A Feast for Crows was published in October, 2005. In Feast, fans were given the full story, but only for half the characters. Fan favorites like Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenarys Targaryen were noticeably missing from the chapters of the book. Martin's now-infamous claim that Dance would be finished within a year ended up haunting him relentlessly until the day that A Dance with Dragons fell into everyone's eager hands. A Dance with Dragons not only completes the story of that missing half, but also continues the story forward. In fact, Dance is the largest book in the series, weighing in at 1,040 pages.So how does this fifth entry in the Song of Ice and Fire series match up to the rest? Read on to find out.Note: It's presumed you've read the series up to the ending of A Feast for Crows, so if you haven't, don't read on.The Prologue certainly draws comparisons to that in A Game of Thrones, taking place far north of the Wall, and giving us glimpses of the White Walkers. This serves to continue the inexorable march of the undead towards the rest of Westeros. Martin is most certainly taking his time drawing out the inevitable confrontation with the Others, however, and some readers may wonder if he'll ever be able to complete this saga, much less in the two books he claims remain. Nevertheless, it's a promising start to the novel.TYRION LANNISTERFinally, after ten long years, fans get new Tyrion material. His story begins perfectly in Dance and we see the Imp wallowing in self-pity and taking careless chances, his life no longer important to him. It doesn't take long for that attitude to change, with the help of some unlikely allies, and rather unexpected revelations.Tyrion sees his ups and downs in this novel, and his luck continues to hold, especially near the end. He's matched up with another dwarf, but where this pairing is going is hard to say. Tyrion's line that he has a heart for \cripples",,but he's still very much Tyrion Lannister,
0.0,"This review is written for Winds of War, and War and Remembrance together. Although two separate books, they are really two halves of the same story, and really need to be considered together. These books may not be Mr. Wouk's finest books, but they are his finest story, and most encompassing work.These books really can be read for three different reasons: First, as a story of a family, and to effects of World War II. Second, as a war story of Sailors in World War II. Third, as a comprehensive history of World War II.This book is a story of a family. It tells of a husband and wife, their three sons, and their daughter, as well as all the love interests involved with these characters. Throughout the two books, we follow the all of these characters, as they interact with each other, and those around us. We get to see the effects of the war on their personal and professional lives, as well as the effects of the war on their relationships.This book is a war story. Many of the characters are directly involved in the war was U.S. Navy Sailors in the war. Most of those characters that are not serving in the military, are still directly involved in the war as diplomats, war correspondents, and other direct or indirect participation. We see many of the major battles, as well as some of the inner workings of politicians and diplomats.Finally, this book is a comprehensive history of World War II. Mr. Wouk puts a comprehensive treatise on World War II from the perspective of a German military officer between narrative chapters. Additionally, because many of the character are involved with the politics and diplomacy of the war, we get a view of the way it affected society as a whole, and the purpose of individual battles.Finally, one last note of caution. This book is a powerful book. It takes place in World War II, some of these characters are Jewish, some of these characters are serving in the military. Some of these chapters will be sad. This book is still amazing and worth reading, but should be approached with this in mind.",07/01/2013 0:00,Comprehensive World War II Story,5.0

Built To Last studies some of the most successful (called the leading companies) and the following companies (non-leaders in an industry). The research for this book produced surprising results for the authors (and the reader). The authors found the there were at least twelve commonly held businesses beliefs that their research refuted. In essence these dearly held business beliefs were myths.Here is a look at each of the twelve myths and a sound byte describing each:1. It takes a great idea to start a company Few visionary companies started with a great idea. Many companies started without any specific ideas (HP and Sony) and others were outright failures (3M). In fact a great idea may lead to road of not being able to adapt.2. Visionary companies require great and charismatic visionary leaders A charismatic leader in not required and, in fact, can be detrimental to a company's long-term prospects.3. The most successful companies exist first and foremost to maximize profits Not true. Profit counts, but is usually not at the top of the list.4. Visionary companies share a common subset of &quot;correct&quot; core values They all have core values, but each is unique to a company and it's culture.5. The only constant is change The core values can and often do last more then 100 years.6. Blue-chip companies play it safe They take significant bet the company risks.7. Visionary companies are great places to work, for everyone These companies are only great places to work if you fit the vision and culture.8. Highly successful companies make some of their best moves by brilliant and complex strategic planning. They actually try a bunch of stuff and keep what works.9. Companies should hire outside CEOs to stimulate fundamental change Most have had their change agents come from within the system.10. The most successful companies focus primarily on beating the competition. They focus on beating themselves.11. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Decisions don't have to either or, but can be boths.12. Companies become visionary primarily through &quot;vision statements&quot;. Vision is not a statement it is the way you do business.I would recommend this book to anyone engaged in developing and running a business at any level.

,"The hierarchy problem has for quite some time been a burning issue in elementary particle physics. There have been many proposals for solving this problem, some of which are quite exotic if viewed from a commonsense viewpoint. But the interactions of elementary particles are described by quantum physics, the latter of which has never been a theory that conformed to any notion of commonsense. Therefore one should not discount a proposal if it seems strange or alien to customary ways of thinking. The physicists of fifty years ago might be shocked at some of these proposals, but the physicists of the twenty-first century are very comfortable with them. Of course, any idea in physics, to be considered viable, must be confirmed by experiment. When a physical theory does, it does not matter at all how seemingly strange it is.The author of this book has given an interesting discussion of the hierarchy problem for the general reader, and has included the necessary background in elementary particle physics that puts the problem in context. Since the book is written for a general reader, the author refrains from using mathematical language. The conceptual compression involved in using mathematics is therefore lost in the book, but the author tries very hard, and succeeds, in explaining difficult concepts in physics to readers who have a real thirst for understanding them (there are however \math notes\"" at the end of the book). The author has made original contributions to the understanding the hierarchy problem",,which is a particular type of five-dimensional curved geometry that is bounded by two (three-dimensional) branes.

2.0,"THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IMAGES FROM THE BIBLE is basically a picture book with selected scenes from the Bible. The illustrations cover two full pages and there is a flap on each page. When the flap are folded over, there is the title of the image, a short description about the image, and a short Bible verse.  The illustrations in this book are gorgeous and when viewing the book, a person realizes why the book is called the most beautiful images from the Bible: these just aren't powerful visual images taken from scripture, but the actual images on these pages are, perhaps some of the most beautiful.  The scenes include:  Adam naming the animals, Noah building the ark, Abraham receiving his covenant from God, Moses drawing water from a rock, Ruth speaking with Naomi, Samuel receiving his prophetic calling, David killing Goliath, a young Jeremiah watching a potter at his wheel, Daniel in the lion's den, Jonah thrown overboard, a shepherd carrying an injured lamb, the birth of Jesus, Jesus being baptized by John, Jesus teaching children, Jesus asleep during the storm at sea, Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, Jesus being mocked by soldiers, the empty tomb, and the moment after Jesus' ascension. My favorite picture in the book is the one with Jonah: it shows the ship moving away from him and beneath the now calming waters, you can see the outline of a giant fish.

7.0,"Islands In The Sky is certainly not on par with such later Clarke masterpieces as 2001 or Rendezvous With Rama, nor is it intended to be. This very, very early Clarke novel is just about the only work in his entire canon that seems to have been written with the teen audience in mind. The protagonist is of the &quot;coming of age&quot; age that is commonly featured in such stories, and Clarke uses this to narrarate the story in a slightly condescending, naive tone that is appropriate for such a character. It's quite different for Clarke, who usually writes in such a philosophical, poetic style. It reminds a lot of Robert A. Heinlein's many excellent juvenile novels. As such, this book, while far from being Clarke's best work, this book serves as an excellent introduction to Arthur C.

7.0,"This is the heart-breaking story of an overly zealous, misguided missionary who sincerely felt he was doing the Lord's work in the Congo.  He put his entire family at risk while he tried to jam what he felt was the Lord's will for these people down their throats.  This tale is also political in that it shows, in no uncertain terms, the negative role the United States played just when the Congolese were attempting to achieve independence from Belgium.  Shame on us for thinking we're the saviour of the world, and thanks to Barbara Kingsolver for her courage in the writing of this book!  The most dramatic and heart-rending moment for me was when the youngest daughter was bitten by the deadly mamba snake (probably the deadliest snake in the world), and died very soon afterwards.  The missionary father eventually descends into a world of madness, and the mother and remaining daughters leave for the states.  It is a story that is still with me, months after having read it.

1.0,"After reading INDELIBLE by Karin Slaughter, I will have now read all of her novels. I realized after reading that I always liked the character Jeffrey Toliver, because he seemed to be the only normal character of the bunch. Well, not after reading this book. It is Tolliver's turn to have his sordid, twisted past revealed. The novel opens with a horrific shootout at the police station where kids are taken hostage and cops are killed.With the hostages in a standoff, the story skips back in time to when Jeffrey and Sarah Linton were dating just a few months. They take a vacation, but on the way, Jeffrey takes him to his home town, a place he hasn't been in years. At first, this part of the novel dragged on compared to the excitement of the hostage situation, but soon, Jeffrey's childhood friends are involved in murder, and Sarah is there to do the autopsy. The rest of the novel is primarily set in the past, where Jeffrey and all his friends seem to have secrets.I didn't really like the skewering of Tolliver. Slaughter really is hard on her characters, almost to a point where it is unrealistic. I mean, does EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER have to be self-destructive. This holds true for her future novels as well. In this novel, Jeffrey seems to crumble at the prospects of facing his own past. Lena is in the clutches of a boy ten years younger than her. Sarah is easily swayed by others' opinion Jeffrey. No one seems to be able to stand up and just do the right thing.This novel almost has too much drama for me. But, I liked it. I'm familiar with the characters, and enjoy following them from book to book. With this novel, I finally have the complete picture.",02/06/2013 0:00,Why does every character have to be so self-destructive?,2.0
0.0,"Note:  I read a paperback version of this book.  I have no idea what all the different paperback versions listed on Amazon are.  No idea if mine was a &#34;revised&#34; edition or not.  So I'm just going to post this review on all the versions listed, maybe somebody will come along later and straighten me out.  The other thing that seems odd is the price on Amazon, it (at the time of this writing) seems really high ($38 for a paperback?)...  Maybe that'll get straightened out as well.<br /><br />My review:<br />One of the most enjoyable reads I've had in quite a while.  Reasonably fast paced without that &#34;must have action every x pages&#34; that some books tend towards.<br /><br />Despite not being a big Military SF fan I tend to read a fair amount of them...  They tend to have linear story lines, conclusive plots, and characters under stress.  All things I like.  On the bad side, they often tend to lack solid characters and realistic outcomes.  Often times the views of military life are overly simplistic.  This book has all those good points and none of the bad.<br /><br />No real spoilers below, but I do mention specific features of the book, be warned...<br /><br />I am particularly impressed by how the protagonist gets bounced around by the giant bureaucracy (very like my experiences) but manages, by applying what little pressure he has at the right times, to end up in more desirable (to him) positions.  Realistic enough that it brought a wave of nostalgia to my mind.  I assume Mr. Kloos is writing from experience.<br /><br />About the only faults I found in this novel are of the nit picky variety.  While the descriptions of combat equipment (and tactics) are quite solid seeming to me, and basically all the technology in the early parts of the book.  Some of the later parts are a bit less so, just as an example:  Escaping from a damaged spaceship there is a specific lack of emergency vacuum survival suits.  The technology on display everywhere else would surely lend itself to cheap single use plastic + small replaceable can of air suits.  Hard to move in, fragile as heck, maybe mostly useless but... Nothing?  There's a few other spots, none critical to the plot, and none worth knocking off even a tenth of a star.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Good book, worth a read.",08/29/2015 0:00,One of the most enjoyable reads I've had in quite a while.

0.0,"By accident, I have lately been reading mystery novels in which the writers have used the distant past as part of the settings for their plots. Tess Gerritsen's &#34;The Bone Garden&#34; reached back to early 19th Century Boston. Lisa Scottoline's &#34;The Vendetta Defense&#34; used Mussolini-era Italy as a backdrop for most of that work. In &#34;Killer Smile&#34;, Scottoline once again skips back through the decades, this time to the internment camps for Italians that existed contemporaneous with the Japanese camps during WWII. To me, this was the most successful of the three novels.Part of the reason for why I feel this was the most successful was that Mary DiNunzio has more at stake here and more closeness to the events than the protagonists of the &#34;The Bone Garden&#34; or even in Scottoline's &#34;The Vendetta Defense&#34;. Her psychology rings true. She is still grieving, though to a lesser degree, for the loss of her husband. This makes her vulnerable to the plight of a young Italian man,  Amadeo Brandolino, who lost his beloved wife during his incarceration at an internment camp. This leads to his alleged suicide. Mary's grief ties in with Amadeo's to the point where she imagines she can hear his cries and pleas. This was as convincing as it was heartbreaking and haunting.Another element that helped the novel was the depiction of the elderly and their own ties to the past. The residents of Montana who had interracted with the Italian detainees have their own stories and secrets. All this created a melancholy texture to a mystery that was, in its own right, credible and engaging.",12/17/2013 0:00,Looking Back with Sorrow and Anger,5.0

Now living with their aunt, Sophie and Veronica are being prepared as debutantes, while Toby continues his haphazard ways at school. Simon has taken on the role as secretary for Aunt Charlotte. The times are unsettled, but most are blissfully unaware of the increasing danger of war. Veronica is far more interested in pushing the cause of Montmaray than going to dances. While often at odds with Simon, they keep the cause of their island kingdom alive, eventually getting a chance to plead their cause to the wider world. While the end of the book has some harrowing adventure, the book also intermingles some humorous moments and a good dollop of history in the process. Henry’s take on the girl guides leads to a rather militant troop that come rallying to the cause at key moments. Her graphic descriptions of the possibilities of war to the young Princess Elizabeth also cause quite the stir.

3.0,"This first of a projected series of Oz books serves as an excellent introduction to young readers who have probably seen the 1939 film, and possibly knew that L. Frank Baum wrote a book about Oz, but have no idea that other Oz books exist.The opening begins in Oz, introducing two strong female characters, one familiar from the movie (Glinda) and one not (Ozma)--and then shifts to two sisters in Lawrence, Kansas, one of whom loves the Oz books, and the other who thinks fantasy is babyish.  The girls' relationship is further strained by the imminent separation of their parents--a situation to which far too many children nowdays can relate.  But that is kept firmly in the background as the girls are swept via tornado (familiar from both movie and first book) to Oz, and then have to adjust, each in her own way.The pacing through the earlier sections is leisurely, introducing concepts slowly.  Even third grade readers should be able to pick up clues about the world of Oz.  My sixth grade daughter, who loves horses, liked the beginning, though my older daughter wanted to skim as did I.One the girls meet the mysterious Rik, the pacing accelerates, and includes more of the famous Oz characters from Baum's books.  They must overcome the niece of the Wicked Witch, at her castle, which is full of scary and funny boobytraps.Accessible to younger readers, and appealing to older reluctant readers, this book is recommended for school libraries.  Perhaps it will spark a renewal of interest in the original Oz books, which are sadly neglected in library choices these days.",08/07/2005 0:00,Good Introduction for Today's Young Readers,5.0

9.0,"I did enjoy Interpreter of Maladies (especially the last story, something about living in 3 continents?), however, it didn't imprint in my mind as much as this book. I thought it was an incredible story of someone's life and the lives of generations. It is written in mostly present-tense and there are very few conversations, but she writes with a calm, sympathetic style, not too poetic or too plain. It is hard to make a story interesting with so little conversation but I enjoyed her way with words and finished the book in one evening. In fact I feel like I can remember almost every detail of the book because of the memorable way that she writes.The main character is Gogol, who is in the book from the time he is inside his mother until he is in his mid-30's. It describes him at different stages- one chapter he's in elementary school, the next he's 14, etc but although it skips a few years in between, it also describes a lot of details. He goes through a lot of trials and tribulations, many of which are because of his name and the cultural expectations put on him, but he also goes through the usual ones, especially love.His name is a recurring theme in this book. His name is given to him for a special reason which has meaning to his father, but for most of the book he doesn't know the reason for his atypical name and he hates it. His name and its origin are small things which have a lot of significance, and an unspoken misunderstanding for most of the book. In the middle of the book he learns why his name is Gogol, but the end is where he comes to understand it (and his father) completely.He spends a lot of time ignoring his culture. He is bored or finds fault with it since he was brought up with it. With friends and girlfriends he observes the details of other cultures and compares them to his own (for example, the dinner party his girlfriends parents have, vs his own family parties). At first he thinks the ways others live is a better way than the way his parents live, especially when it comes to relationships (being arranged vs falling in love). As he grows older I think he finds peace with his own culture, particularly with the death of his father, and he admires his parents in some ways. He starts to appreciate the traditions he was brought up with, while still being part of the larger American mainstream.I was really rooting for him throughout the entire story, feeling for him when things weren't working out- especially his wife, who didn't appreciate him even though he did everything he could for her. This book is a tear-jerker in some places (though I didn't cry, I think someone could), for instance the time his father almost told him the reason for his name, the time he finally did tell him, every time he falls in love, and the ending...well I don't want to give that away but it was a little sad and sweet at the same time.This book has sadness in it, but it doesn't have anything that is over-the-top tragic either, and that's another thing I like. The family has some disagreements but they still love each other and are close. The generations have things they don't understand about each other but there are also no door-slamming arguments, no one gets disowned, and no one gets in a fight right before someone dies either. In that way I think it was a realistic portrayal of intergenerational relationships in a lot of families - in fact it reminds me a lot of my own family.",03/25/2006 0:00,I like it MORE than Interpreter of Maladies!,5.0

Another might be a more oblique definition, used more in business dealings...and then there's always the everyday dealings we come across in our lives.  Michael C. White has utilized all of these references in his wonderful new novel, &quot;A Dream Of Wolves&quot;.

Seen through Doc's eyes, we witness the trials and tribulations that seem magnified in a town of such size. &quot;Doc&quot;, a &quot;yank&quot; from Maine, is the towns only OB/GYN and practicing medical examiner, a chore he'd much sooner be rid of, since he's getting on in years, and feels that his plate is already too full.

That alone is cause for this reviewer to pick up his books.A therapist and child advocate, Crutcher is one of the finest authors I've read for teens.  He not only uses real experiences with real adolescents to form his characters, he hits young adult reality fiction right on.  Crutcher is honest, straightforward, and not afraid to tackle the hard subjects coming-of-age lessons forge.  And boy, do kids respond.ANGRY MANAGEMENT is Crutcher's latest novel.  Built out of three novellas involving some familiar characters from past books, adolescents and grown ups alike who can't appreciate the honesty and raw emotion brought forth from these characters do so out of fear of today's reality.The novellas are connected by Mr. Nak's (IRONMAN, 1995, HarperCollins) Angry Management group, a place where teens who don't follow the norm meet to tell their stories.  The stories they've lived from the cards they've been dealt.Anger is most definitely a theme in these pages, but so are love and prejudice, freedom of religion and abuse.  Hope and survival.  Crutcher has a way of pulling at the deep, raw emotion we all possess, especially for kids, and bringing it to the surface.  No wonder so many find his work threatening.Reviewed by:  Angie Fisher",02/03/2010 0:00,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,5.0

Being a senior the title of this book (Pimp my walker: the official book of old age haiku by Mike Slosberg) caught my attention.  This little 96 page hardcover volume has 73 haiku along with numerous cartoons to spice up the book.<br /><br />The last page encourages you to write your own haiku, which consists of 17 syllables, with a three line poem of 5 syllables on the first and third lines and 7 syllables on the middle like.<br /><br />A few of the amusing old age poems in this volume include the following:<br />“I can remember  “High school reunion<br />When sex was better than food  Everyone looks so ancient<br />Now vice is versa”  Except yours truly”<br /><br />“We’ve stopped arguing,  “My grandson and I<br />Not a good sign, since conflict  Have something big in common.<br />  Helps circulation”  We both wear pampers”<br /><br />This little book was a quick 10 minute read; nevertheless, I found it a sometimes funny but most of the time amusing book relating haiku.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.

5.0,"Having read Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, I wanted to give another one of Gregory Maguire's retold fairytales a whirl.  Mirror, Mirror is the retelling of Snow White from the evil Lucrezia Borgia's point of view.  Set in sixteenth century Italy, Maguire tells the story of Lucrezia and how she takes over the home of Vicente de Nevada and his other Bianca.  When Vicente is sent away on an assignment, Lucrezia decides to make young Bianca's life a living hell.  She plans to murder Bianca and be with Vicente.  But things don't turn out that way.  Bianca survives and is protected by seven dwarves, and Lucrezia might meet with the estranged girl sooner than she had expected.Mirror, Mirror has a rather dark language.  This is not the cute Disney story by a long shot!  I loved the historical setting and the fanciful language throughout the novel.  One of the things I enjoyed the most about this retelling is how the author describes the dwarves.  The aforementioned characters are told in quite a different way from the original fairytale.  I quite enjoyed the creativity that came from recreating the characters.  Lucrezia Borgia remains to be evil and calculative here, but with an edge that transcends all previous attempts to recreate the aforementioned villainess.  I loved Mirror, Mirror.  I enjoyed this book more than Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister.  I look forward to reading more books by Gregory Maguire.",03/17/2005 0:00,"Beautiful, fanciful retelling of a classic!",4.0
0.0,"This is the first Philippa Gregory book I've read, and I really did enjoy reading it. It's very detailed, very dramatic, and regardless of other reviews that claim it to be slow, I didn't mind at all because I love reading all the details. There's a lot of accurate history in the book, which is a plus, and because of this book, my interest in this time period has definitely peaked, and after reading, I went back and did my own research.There were a few things that bothered me intensely about the main character that made it hard for me to really like her. She kind of just went with the flow and liked everyone (Elizabeth/Mary/Dudley), which in those times, I don't think you could really play on everyone's side (and mean it- and not get caught and tried for treason). And her love interest. I really hoped she would've handled things differently. The ending was NOT satisfying for me. Which generally would bother me, but I was so caught up in most of the other elements of the book, and I guess I just realized that Hannah is Hannah, and I didn't really get attached to her in a way to care too much what happened to her either way.Besides that, it makes for an interesting read, and I loved reading about the Mary/Elizabeth sides.",04/04/2009 0:00,"Interesting Read, got me more interested in history",4.0

17.0,"This is one of the best social histories I have read.  Zinn is a masterful writer, and his interpretation of American history will certainly shake a few people up.  This is most certainly not the &quot;Mom and apple pie&quot; history you learned in high school, where the European settlers are the good guys in white hats bringing civilization to the New World. And its about time.Zinn writes from the perspective of the conquored, the small farmer, the little guy and the minority: those who have not had a voice for so long. The history is an ugly one of greed and self-serving manipulation - tongue in cheek, the things that have made America great. Zinn points out the lesser known facts about our founding fathers (they were the richest men in the colonies, with ulterior economic motivations for rebellion), about our presidents (Andrew Jackson made his claim to fame killing indians in the southeast) and about our conflicts (draft riots and draft dodgers during the civil war.)This is not to say that Zinn turns history on its head. He does not.  Nor is this to say that Zinn is a subversive, attacking all that American's hold sacred. What A People's History of the United States does, is give history back to the people. It reminds us that as much as we would like to believe otherwise, America has a sordid history, and that often times the little guy got the short end of the stick.The prose is easy to read, and the subject matter is interesting - espeically for those with more than a passing interest in US history. If you are easily offended, or are uncomfortable with what some call &quot;revisionist&quot; history, spare yourself the ulcer and don;t read the book.

I saw this book was coming out and I had to have it.<br /><br />This isn't a &#34;cookbook&#34; per se as it is a book about making kitchen staples: so much of vegan cooking these days includes substituting a vegan version of a dairy product, which can be both expensive and unhealthy. Schinner has put together recipes for staples like mayonnaise, butter, soy milk, yogurt, cheeses, snack bars, and onto more elaborate fair like fresh pasta, jams, stocks, and for some a very exciting section on making fake meats from tofu, okara (byproduct of homemade soy milk) and homemade seitan. Making these things yourself gives you control over the quality of ingredients and is also extremely cost effective. In many ways, this is kind of a vegan homemaking book, so be prepared to invest some time and planning into making the best use of these recipes. Only rarely does she call for uncommon ingredients (tofu skins, fermented tofu, carrageenan), but these are easily found at Asian groceries or health stores.<br /><br />One great this about this book is that the recipes work. Often cookbooks that include recipes for pantry items or refrigerator staples and while the concept is enticing,  you follow the recipe and come out with something very disappointing. Not so for Homemade Vegan Pantry! After trying roughly half the recipes in the book, they've all come out great.

0.0,"I had high hopes for this book given the good reviews on amazon, and the conceit of the conservative reporter who secretly writes porn was cute.The book was really let down, however, by the main love interest, Luc, and the dynamic between him and Jane. I understand the gruff alpha male is a well used trope and I am not always averse to it, but Luc was immature, incredibly chauvinist, shallow, and downright cruel, to both Jane and his sister. Cluelessness with regards to the young sister he is suddenly a guardian to can only excuse so much - for most of the book he was frankly pretty awful.Also, I have nothing against romances where the main characters don't get along at first - that can be fun - but the constant references to how sexless and unattractive he found her were really off putting and just made him seem incredibly vacuous and shallow, not to mention mean. It was compounded by the fact that she didn't even give as good as she got - oh sure, there was some attempt at writing banter but we kept hearing about how she secretly wanted him to like her because he was so hot.Ugh.

2.0,"My classroom became very interested in genetics during a discussion of cancer.  I was very motivated to have this book available to my fourth grade students.  The book is labeled for 8-12 year old's, but there were so many gaps in its presentation of the information, that it is too difficult for that age group.  Even I had to read some passages several times to keep the author's message straight.  This book does not feel like authentic literature.  It feels like the author grabbed a checklist from Common Core and wrote a book around meeting the standards.  It feels like a textbook or teachers' edition, rather than a resource to be read by children.  In the discussion of dominant and recessive traits, the book begins using those words without any concrete definition of the words, human examples or a chart that organizes how those traits are passed down.  Those components are basic to early learning about genetics and I feel like they threw them out.  In the discussion of X and Y chromosomes, again a chart would have been helpful.  2 pages worth of discussion about X and Y chromosomes and their connection to fruit flies with white eyes is just too abstract for this age group.  As I mentioned before, I had to reread it in order to keep my X's and Y's straight. Finally, in the discussion on mitosis and meiosis, there is a graphic organizer showing  the process, but there are no labels.  The changes are  too subtle to follow without pointing them out.  Again, this book fails to make anything concrete and relies too much on inferences.  Frequently, this book asks Common Core type questions and then suggests you go online to get the answer.  Here's an example:  &#34;Reread Chapter 4 of this book.  How is the information provided on the Web site different from the information in this chapter?  How do the 2 sources present information similarly?&#34;  This bugged me because I was looking for information about genetics, not a lesson or test-like question on using resources.Later in the book, students are asked to find another book about cells and write a short essay comparing the new source's point of view.  The term &#34;point of view&#34; implies a persuasive or narrative piece of writing, not non-fiction.  There are just too many problems to recommend this book.",08/28/2015 0:00,Look Elsewhere for a Resource on Genetics,1.0
3.0,"Working in education, I find Hayden's books a good read. It's always interesting to know how other professionals deal with the most horrific cases of abuse. I find her quite self-deprecating as well, able to admit when something just didn't work or when she made errors of judgement.One Child is my favourite of her books; the emotions involved in educating this child are very intense. However, some reviewers' comments about the level of attachment, confidentiality laws and physical contact with the child (lots of hugging etc) are justified. I believe she did get far too emotionally attached to this girl (and vice versa as a consequence), causing further problems. That simply would not be allowed to happen these days. Remember she is recalling events from the 1970s, when things were very different. I would be around Sheila's age then, and I remember similar affection and cuddles from  teachers.I am from the UK and although I am bearing the era in mind, I am still shocked at the poor quality of social work in this story. Migrant workers in our country would receive a council flat and benefit payments, and their kids would probably be the best dressed ones in class! Maybe, after reading this tale, that wouldn't be such a bad thing. How can children be allowed to live like that?Perhaps we do need to change the laws and allow teachers to be surrogate mothers again. It seems some kids don't have anything else.If you loved this book you will probably already have looked at some of her others, but I particularly recommend The Tiger's Child (the sequel to this) and Ghost Girl, which will leave you wondering about the sanity of this world.",01/07/2010 0:00,Mixed emotions,4.0

1.0,"Rabbi Angel demonstrates his well-known knowledge and writing skills in this very informative exploration Jewish practices. He offers details about and explains Jewish daily observances and holidays, the differences between Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jewry, the unique Jewish use of time, halakhah, theology, history, sacred places, divine revelation and providence, confronting death with the right attitude and without fear, the significance of the State of Israel, the manner in which Jews highlight and celebrate family, how people can transcend themselves, and much more. I’ll give some examples.<br /><br />The rabbi stresses the importance of a sensitive relationship between humans and nature. The Bible emphasizes this relationship by speaking about creation in the beginning of the Bible. Additionally, all of the biblical holidays are related to nature: spring (Passover), summer (Shavuot), and fall (Sukkot). Many blessings do not focus on what is eaten but on the renewal of nature. Jews recite blessings when they observe natural phenomenon such as lightning, thunder, very strong winds, and rainbows. They approach God in a two-fold manner, through the divine creation of nature and the divine revelation of the Torah. But it is God that is the most important; therefore Jews turned to the west away from the sun as they left the temple.<br /><br />He writes, “There has been a steady and increasing alienation between Jewish religious observance and the natural world, with a parallel diminution in sensing awe for God as Creator of the natural universe.” He points, for example, to the wide-spread current practice of placing stained-glass windows in synagogues, which obstructs outside views and “symbolize a changed sense of spirituality, a break from traditional outdoor religiosity.”<br /><br />Rabbi Angel describes some Sephardic practices, such as the custom during the Passover Seder “of placing a piece of matzah in a sack and carrying it on their shoulders as though they were among the Israelites of old carrying their belongings as they escaped from Egypt.” This practice, as many similar Sephardic ones during Passover and other Jewish holidays, deepens the holiday, “we are sharing a historical national memory and we are attempting to identify ourselves with our redeemed ancestors.”<br /><br />The Jewish meal is another example of our identification with our ancestors. “The table upon which one eats is considered symbolically to be the altar in the Temple in Jerusalem. It is consecrated. One is not supposed to treat the table with disrespect, to sit on it, to place one’s shoes on it. Before eating a meal, we ritually wash our hands as a sign of purification. Just as Jews in ancient Jerusalem had to purify themselves before coming to the altar, so we must do likewise. We recite the blessing over bread, but before eating it we dip it in salt. This is reminiscent of the practice in the Temple to add salt to the sacrifices offered on the altar.”<br /><br />Rabbi Angel gives readers an extensive interesting historical account of the ancient great court in Jerusalem, popularly known as the Sanhedrin, comprised of seventy-one scholars. Readers may be surprised to learn that the Great Court “even had the power to overrule a law of the Torah (see, for example, the discussion in the Talmud, Yevamot 90b.” Maimonides wrote in his Mishneh Torah, Laws of Rebels 2:1, that in ancient times the law was fluid and flexible. Each Court had the right and responsibility to use its own understanding in applying the word of God to the people of Israel. Each Court “ruled according to the way it seemed to them that the law should be – their judgment is the law. If a subsequent Great Court found a reason to refute their decision, it should refute it” for the Torah states we are “only obligated to follow the Court which is in your generation.”<br />This power to change laws was traditionally given only to the Great Court. Unfortunately, the Great Court ceased to operate when the Romans destroyed the temple in 70 CE. Several efforts were made to reestablish the authority of the Court, but these efforts failed. The latest call for the reinstitution of the Great Court was made by the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Benzion Uziel (1880-1953) in 1936, but his call went unheeded. Soon thereafter the dissolution of the Court in 70 CE, in the mid-second century, Rabbi Yehuda the Prince compiled the Mishnah, a record of the rabbinical teachings up to his time. From then on, the Mishnah and the subsequent discussions on the Mishnah in the Gemara, together called the Talmud, one composed in Israel and the more widely accepted one in Babylon, became, together with later composed law codes, the fixed laws. Rabbis no longer went to the Torah to determine the law. Today, the law, called halakhah, is no longer fluid.<br /><br />Rabbi Angel discusses the different approach that Sephardic rabbis take to Jewish law and Judaism from that of Ashkenazic rabbis after the time of the Great Court. Ashkenazim primarily lived in Europe under Christian domination under harsh conditions and were generally unable to secure a secular education. It wasn’t until the eighteenth and nineteenth century that these Jews were westernized. In contrast, Sephardim had a far better life in Spain until they were expelled in 1492. They made great contributions to the Spanish culture in science, medicine, philosophy, and mathematics. Whereas Jews in Ashkenazic lands – France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, and Eastern Europe – lived a sober, melancholy life, and focused on piety because of their restraint, Sephardic Jews were on the whole a happy people. While they were quite observant of halakhah, their observance did not lead them to become sober or overly serious. “Rather, the pleasures and aesthetics of this world were viewed in a positive light. Sephardic holiday celebrations and lifecycle observances, for example, were characterized by the preparation of elaborate delicacies to eat, the singing of songs, and a general spirit of gaiety and hospitality…. This spirit carried itself even to the serious season of the High Holy Days, when self-scrutiny and repentance were expected…. The unstated assumption was that eating, rejoicing, and being happy of heart were not in conflict with piety, even in the serious season of penitential prayers.”<br /><br />The effect of Christian persecution upon Ashkenazic Jewry also resulted in Ashkenazic rabbis being more stringent in their halakhic rulings. “H. J. Zimmels, in his book ‘Ashkenazim and Sephardim’…suggests that Ashkenazic inclination to stringency was largely the result of centuries of persecution suffered by German Jewry.” Rabbi Angel also cites Chief Rabbi Benzion Uziel who wrote that Sephardic rabbis “felt powerful enough in their opinion and authority to annul customs that were not based on halakhic foundations. In contrast, Ashkenazic rabbis tended to strengthen customs and sought support for them even if they seemed strange and without halakhic basis.”<br /><br />Among much else, Rabbi Angel discusses how understanding how to die tells us how to live. He notes that the Midrash Genesis Rabbah interprets the divine statement in Genesis “Behold it was very good” as referring to death. He explains how both nature and the Torah provide paths to God and that God’s revelation through nature may be experienced today by all people, Jews and non-Jews alike.perate when the Romans destroyed the temple in 70 CE.

8.0,"Val Brelinski’s debut novel, The Girl Who Slept with God, drew my attention initially because of its cultural context, an evangelical Christian family in 1970’s rural Idaho. The story centers around fourteen-year-old Jory Quanbeck, who has been banished by her parents to an isolated house on the outskirts of town, along with her pregnant older sister, Grace. Although Jory’s understanding of what is normal has been hemmed in by a religion which bans “mixed bathing,” dancing, playing cards, makeup, movies, pierced ears, and miniskirts, among many other banal practices, she herself remains open to and curious about the world and the people around her. Her journey outside the strict confines of church and parental supervision leads her into the messy and mysterious life of high school, her first experience of romantic love, and a burgeoning understanding of the painful and sometimes tragic world of adults, including her own parents. The book is beautifully written, a delight to read for its artistry as well as for its compelling story and characters.<br />Religion is not an easy topic to write about, particularly one which is often the brunt of jokes or the basis of caricatures. Brelinski has managed to create characters whose lives burst out of their religious beliefs. The Quanbecks are real, accessible, and interesting in their own right, as far away as one could get from flat representations of a type. The treatment of fundamentalist Christianity in the story is subtle, complex, and humane, and avoids being reductive in any way.",08/27/2015 0:00,"A gorgeous book, one of my favorites of the year",5.0

2.0,"What can I say that has not been written before - it's Cromwell, and Henry and Ann Boleyn ...but Ms Mantel makes it all riveting, and new again! It turns out even in Henry's time, it was all about the Economy, of course!! The peers of the realm, assuming their power comes by their noble birth, have no understanding of the power of money! Enter the brilliant Cromwell! He can simplify the balance sheet of the kingdom to one page, easy for even Henry to grasp. He has connections with bankers all over Europe- he can assess cloth, gems, food, wines, estates at one glance. And he gives sound advice,  though with great charm and courtesy.I loved his dialogues as he climbs up the social scale - inscisive, witty, self deprecating. I loved the deliberate contrast between the able, whip smart young men trained by Cromwell and the effete, arrogant dandies who don't know and don't care about the undercurrents at the court.The greatest pleasure in this book comes from seeing how the smallest gestures, stratagems, bargains and advice offered by Cromwell are all part of a very deliberate, cohesive plan that unfolds slowly. finally forming a large silky web with the king in the middle, courtiers caught all around and Cromwell quietly spinning away in the corner.I really enjoyed reading her version of Henry's obsession with Ann, and her extreme smug satisfaction when she weds and becomes a queen.

From Buddha to Coehlo, and countless others in between, there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that, once lifted, opens the mind, heart and soul to universal wisdom.It is not hard to understand why Gibran was as popular in his day, and in the 1960's, as he was.  Covering the landscape from religion to love, Gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the Prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey.  The metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional.The book itself is nearly 100 pages, but the content is not readable at any level rapidly.

3.0,"Killing Cupid is a psychological thriller by authors Mark Edward and Louise Voss - two voices perfectly woven and in tune with each others styles yet different enough to generate a sense of perspective and emotional depth to the lead characters which may have proven difficult for other authors. Flipping the script on the traditional stalker experience, 'Killing Cupid' sees the stalked turned stalker in a dark and twisted turn of events between lead characters Alex - a twenty something aspiring writer, and Siobhan - a one time author reduced to teaching a writing class after lack luster sales from her solo published effort. Naturally the two meet during the night class and in no time Alexs' infatuation grows apparent while Siobhan's revulsion and subtle apprehension to disregard the seriousness of Alex's advancements draws further insight into her psyche as the story progresses and eventually turns on its head. Through a series of events, good for Alex, bad for Siobhan, the feel of the novel changes in a heartbeat and I found myself suddenly switching sides before I realised what had happened. 'Killing Cupid' is a breath of clean crisp air with a hint of madness and side effect of disillusioned affection sure to grab your attention and not let go until the uniquely happily ever after ending - 4 stars.",08/01/2011 0:00,Love Hurts,4.0

I'm glad I did, and I'll have to give Farseer another try.Possibly spoilers here...First the good stuff.  The magic was really kool.  The whole system was very intricate and believable.  The wizardwood was really intriguing and even though the liveships do kind of have a cheese factor, I still liked it.  The story was really a pageturner, I looked forward to picking up the book everyday ( I read it on breaks at work mostly).  A lot of the characters broke out of the stereotypes of pirates and such although Althea...I dunno she kind of seemed too much the spunky heroine ya know?  I liked her and all...but she wasn't the most interesting of the bunch.  The most I liked her was when she did something I didn't expect, which was only a couple times...the plot point of her dressing up as a boy could be seen a mile away.  But it doesn't put a damper on it, I think she still has potential in the rest of the story esp with Brashen.  I also liked her thing with the woodworking girl Amber...which wasn't as much as I wish it would have been.  The world was nice, and I liked the family dynamics and the contract with the Creepy Traders...although Malta was a bore.  Kyle...who can say why Ephrom ever trusted him for a moment?Now for some of the not so good stuff...Paragon...I don't know, he was interesting but just a bit too blank sometimes characterwise.  I can see why that could be since he lost his memories...but some of the stuff with him and Amber I didn't think added much to the story.Interminable setting details...could have been A LOT shorter and tighter if some of that stuff was left out.While I really liked Kennit and his whore...I wish there were more background information about what made him the way he is...hopefully that will be brought out in the next two books...but I would have liked more in this one!  It would have made him less of just a villain.Wintrow...was interesting and everything it's just I didn't find myself liking him very much at all.  That's not all bad...I realize not every character has to be likable...but I had to read a lot about him and I thought he was spiteful and pompous...but I do see room for him to grow and I hope he doesI think the worst aspect of the book was the serpents...it did not go anywhere and was just a muddle.  I know we'll see more...but bring it somewhere in the first book!Most of this stuff is probably nitpicking...but I gave the book four stars and overall it is a really good book...just a few things that maybe will be resolved over the course of the trilogy but I wished were brought to a better tantalizing crescendo in the first book.Happy reading!",04/14/2009 0:00,Nice start!,4.0

1.0,"A People History of American Empire is a very interesting book that shows the side of American history not taught in schools and little people know about. Howard Zinn, the author of this book has done a great job telling the plights of the dark side of the American Government. This book reveals one fact about the Government, the decisions they make keep repeating in a never ending cycle. The book, even though it is a graphic novel is just as informative as an actual book yet more entertaining. This book is a very good read as it is very educational. The reason I chose this book is because of my love of history. This book seemed like an average history book about the US. But the book surprised me in the way that it told of facts not known to most of the general public. Most of the events conveyed in the book I did not know of until reading this book. This book is so good that I would not just highly recommend this book for High School students but most of the American People. This book needs to be read by most American people as the government largely affects our daily lives. Knowing the governments past decisions will help especially the students as they will be in charge in the near future. They will know the consequences each decision has had and compare it to similar decisions in the future. Since we live in a democracy we can make decisions for our country. This book will help people make decisions that may prevent an unneeded war or a bad law. In the past we have made many unneeded war efforts. In 2003 America invaded Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein and grant freedom to the Iraqi people. But instead American retained control of Iraq. Almost a hundred years earlier America had invaded the Philippines promising them freedom from Spain. Instead American had held on to the islands after taking it over from the Spanish. The Government makes decisions in a never ending cycle as they keep repeating over and over. This is why it is key to know the history as history always repeats itself. This book exceeded my expectations as it told of facts not really known by the general public. I like learning about new things so this book was a nice read. Overall this was one of my favorite history books to read.",08/30/2015 0:00,Awesome,5.0

1.0,"Four-and-a-half stars would be more accurate.  Not a perfect book, but a very good read.  I've been to Cuba and read everyting I can find about it, especially novels set there.  Latour reveals much of the miserable truth about life in dingy Havana in the course of this facinating page turner. The novel's hero, Elliot Steil, runs into a mysterious stranger in Cuba who pursuades him to head for Miami. A series of peculiar events in the United States leads him to uncover the chilling secrets of his family. He thinks through his dilemma with  originality, cunning, and practicality so typical of intelligent Cubans who are forced to live by their wits in their beleaguered country. This glimpse inside the clever Cuban mind was the most fascinating part of the book for me.The worst flaw is revealing to the reader the identity of the killer by inference long before the hero gets it. Latour also lards in just a few too many complaints about the money-centric quality of life in the USA, but he may have had to do so in order to get published in Cuba.I look forward to Latour's next book and recommend it to crime readers and to those curious about the lives of Cubans who make the dangerous trip  to the USA.",05/05/2001 0:00,A surprisingly wonderful read,4.0

,"This fascinating and tragic account of the nineteenth-century blizzard that killed scores of people is rich with personal, political and scientific detail that placed the storm in the context of America's push to settle its frontier.  Laskin traces the fate of several families induced by the Homestead Act to travel to the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa from their native European and Ukranian homelands, to establish new farms in the harsh environment of the Plains states.  Focusing on their children - caught by the blizzard on the way home from school - made the story all the more poignant.The best parts of the book focused on the personal stories of these families, how they were caught in the storm, and affected in its aftermath.  One schoolteacher braved the storm after (possibly) tying schoolchildren together and all survived.  Another lost more than half of his class trying to travel less than a quarter mile to safety.  However, Laskin pulled too many people into the narrative, which made their stories difficult to follow at times.  Likewise, the evolution and fate of Army Signal Corp. officers who failed to predict the storm, while interesting, was cluttered with too many backstories, that seemed to bear little or no relationship to the tragedy unfolding in the Plains.Some of the most fascinating passages just talked about the weather.  Laskin made dry meteorological details equal parts magical and terrifying as seen through the recollections of nineteenth century pioneers.  \The air popped and sizzled when a hand was passed over someone's head",,pulverized by the storm,

She’s promiscuous — so much so that she’s had an abortion. And she got the star quarterback killed because she was obsessed with him and kept texting him, causing him to become distracted while driving.<br /><br />But are any of these things The Truth About Alice?<br /><br />Told from a rotating first-person point of view from four people who interact with Alice, Jennifer Mathieu’s debut novel seeks to fill in some of the details, looking at what is true and what’s been greatly exaggerated. It’s fairly clear from the early moments of the novel that no one could be nearly as awful as everyone says Alice is, but there are some grains of truth in the rumors. But those grains may not always have been planted exactly where you think they were.<br /><br />I’ll admit some of the revelations seem a bit obvious — but that’s with the benefit of spending a few chapters with each character and finding out that he or she knows more than he or she is telling. The novel doesn’t shy away from the devastation Alice feels or the shame she endures. It also serves as an interesting warning about the power of words and how sometimes people may be protesting too much.<br /><br />Alice isn’t a saint. But then again, neither is anyone else.

,"Dan Simmons has written a masterfull work.  I have marked down four stars when I really give it 4 1/2.  This is wonderfull to read.  Simmons also writes an anecdote to each story about the story or his connection to writing the story.  In his anecdotes, you find that he loves where he lives and loves the annual neighborhood get togethers.  He also loves writing, but not necessarily the business of writing.  Taken together, they add a nice depth to his writing and gives you a greater appreciation to his stories.  There are five here and not one of them is a dud.  He returns to Hyperion in one of the stories and the reader would enjoy the story more if they had read the series, but the story still stands on its own legs.  He also writes about mountain climbing with aliens and the brotherhood that develops with such an activity whether you are human or not.

2.0,"Christopher Hallowell is not your average environmentalist bemoaning the impending loss of a part of America's natural beauty. Hallowell is a writer who travelled to the Louisiana coast and fell in love with its people and wonders. Now, with Holding Back the Sea, he returns some 20+ years later and chronicles the disappearing south Louisiana coast.The coast's disappearance, according to Hallowell, affects more than just the natural beauty of the area. It affects the petroleum and seafood supply for nearly half of the United States. It affects the livelihoods and a way of life for thousands of Louisianans who live and thrive in these bayou swamplands. And it puts the city of New Orleans at severe risk of disastrous hurricanes and severe flooding.Hallowell presents in everyman language the history of Louisiana, and especially southern coastal Louisiana, and shows how this history for hundreds of years has had its effect on the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico delta in Louisiana. He does so through very human contact with the people who live on the bayou and affect it's future.It is this homey touch, this affinity for humans, that makes Hallowell's appeal so much more effective than the appeals for endangered plant life that the typical environmentalist authors bombard us with.As Hallowell points out, the fight to save the Louisiana coast has been joined by environmentalists, government bureacrats, politicians, and corporations a like. And it will take all of their cooperation and wisdom to solve a problem that is only getting worse. Hallowell makes very clear the stagnation in efforts to save the coast. As a matter of fact, the way that Hallowell slips from optimism at the beginning of the book to frustration and discouragement near the end of the book, is disconcerting but likely very typical of the frustrations felt by south Louisianans.I was disappointed that the book took such a discouraging turn. It is testament to how bureacracies trying to solve problems often merely stop any progress that otherwise may be made.This is a must read for politicians and others who view the loss of the Louisiana coast as inconsequential.

,"Before I get into the review, let me first say that I am a fan of Dean Koontz, though I have not read every Odd book.  I read the first two and enjoyed them and picked back up with Odd Apocalypse.  I disliked Odd Apocalypse but read enough positive reviews to give this book a chance.  The original Odd Thomas is a bit of a distant memory for me, so I recall more the senses of the book and the characters rather than specific things.  I do know that Odd was likable in the first two books, and that has changed with the past two books.  This book is so poor it makes me question Dean Koontz as a writer as well as a storyteller.Every person Odd ever meets would likely be the most unusual person you or I would ever meet.  He meets an old woman (after having a food fight in a grocery store, chancing across a running Ford Explorer that was being used as a getaway vehicle for a bank robbery, and being run-off the road and flipping the vehicle) who seemed to be the size of a dwarf among her many eccentricities.  As well, Odd meets a woman with the whitest teeth he's ever seen, another woman who had the constellations in her eyes, men who were so handsome they looked like living Ken dolls, and so on and so forth.  Every single sentence of this work feels forced.  The grocery store food fight feels forced.  The rhinestone cowboy feels forced.  The dialogue between Odd and his new employer is so unnatural, and repetitive it felt like no editor had even glanced at it. \Call me Edie",,leads to paragraphs or pages,

More than anything else, the deep respect and gratitude that Thomas has for his grandfather is evident throughout all 290 pages. It seems his religiosity aided that mentality.

1.0,"In a way, this book comes in two flavors - Captain Cook's actual voyages, and the author's visiting the places that the captain had discovered. Of this, the three voyages are well known and have been written up sufficiently. But Horwitz puts an interesting slant on the natives Cook encountered rather than the discoveries themselves. We learn about the Tahitians and their customs, the Maoris of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia, and the people of Tonga, of Hawaii, and the Aleuts of Unalaska. He acquaints us with Cook's main helper, the biologist Joseph Banks, and some of his officers, such as William Bligh of later mutiny fame, and John Ledyard who is still remembered in Connecticut (ironically, the town bearing his name now sports a gigantic native Indian gambling casino).And so the islands were pristine and at peace. It is the author's aim to show us how this has changed into murder, thievery and disease. There are not many of the natives left and those he found were most anxious to forget about Cook. his discoveries and their aftermath. It would be wrong, of course, to blame all this on Cook. If it had not been for him, somebody else would have discovered the islands of the Pacific - and probably with the same results.The conclusion: One should not supplant an original culture with one's own imported one. Both will suffer and there will never be a satisfactory result. Yet such action continues into our 21st century.",09/02/2003 0:00,The Discovery and the Aftermath,5.0

This is not a deep, dry book about economic theories of why crashes happened (eg 1987), or of what mainstream economic theories or principles were at work (interest rates, junk bonds, etc). Instead it's a story about people, greed, fear, the media, the manias, and the main bull-market financial fuels of the times.I particularly liked the use of headlines of the day, quotes from people of the times, and so on, because I remember lots of them from living through it. Looking back, it's like the bull market was a hurricane, sucking up huge amounts of money from junk bonds, from corporate accounting manipulations, and from individual investors to feed the storm. And to last for 20 years, even when people knew it was going to eventually pop -- wow.Recommended, definitely.

,"Howard Roark is a guy with a vision.  Problem is that no one else shares it.  He's been kicked out of an architectural school because his ideas are just too modern and he looks upon his education as a useless effort in rebuilding the past.  Doric columns are of another age.  It's time to move on and create functional buildings instead of monuments to ancient deities.  How Roark's life all plays out becomes an adventure into a society that in 1922 is all about pleasing others and getting ahead  instead of finding inner satisfaction of doing work that is up to one's own standards. (Is this sounding familiar?)  He goes as far as quitting his profession and going to work in a quarry.Roark moves on in his quest to fulfill his dreams of creating structures that as he puts it transform nature to another level.

,"Without RemorseBy Tom ClancyReview by Roger D. NoriegaJohn Clark - Mister John Clark. CIA agent extradonaire. The man that the agency turns to when it wants the job done. He is the one that must go into hostile territory to bring someone out to safety. He blends in well, speaks several languages and is intelligent and smart - rare for the CIA. His only concern is to complete the mission, but he suffers the failings of real people, he makes mistakes and he does endure bouts of fear - fear of failure for the danger is always real and is what he lives for.John Terrance Kelly is an ex-seal recovering from the loss of his beloved wife and  unborn child, killed by by a mechanical failure on a semi-truck. On a get-away holiday Friday, John Kelly meets a hitchhiker and both become attached to each other right quick as both hide demons. He killed for a living and she was killing herself for her living.John discovers that she is a hooker and drug user and decides to clean her up and bring her back to the land of the living. She accepts him and all that he does for her, but she still fears those that kept her as a hooker: she knows that they can still hurt her as they hurt others - namely her fellow captive hookers. Kelly convinces her to speak to the police but before, Kelly decides to spend time in her old neighborhood while he was waiting for his secretive appointment with Baltimore's finest and they meet it with Billy, the pimp that kept Pam and the others doing their bidding. Kelly evades them with some slick maneuvering in the muddy lots of the abandoned neighborhood. Turns out that he didn't do enough as Billy and his buddies catch up with them and shot Kelly point-blank with a shotgun, take Pam and kill her.Kelly should have died, but he survived the wounds and he recovers with a simple mission on his mind: avenge the loss of Pam and maybe, just maybe, save others as well from their certain death at the hands of the drug-dealers.We learn what drives him and he realizes he made a mistake, a fatal mistake that cost Pam her life. He works out and gets into tip-top shape and he begins the hunt. He learns how the drug dealers operate and he begins to attack the drug dealers in different manners to through off the police of Baltimore. With each calculated kill, he moves deeper into the organization and he gains knowledge - all to avenge the loss of Pam. He has no other choice, live with her loss, a loss he caused, or avenge her so that she can rest as well as he.On the other side of the world, a super-secret remote-piloted drone snaps a picture of an American POW declared dead by the Vietcong being tortured.

She decides to brave scandal and ask Rees for a divorce - which he flatly refuses to give her.  She then decides that she'll just take a lover and get her child that way - serve Rees right!  She basically gets a makeover, cutting her hair and dressing more fashionably and daringly the better to lure a potential lover.  And attract men she does - most particularly the Earl of Mayne who becomes infatuated with the new Helene.  But Rees discovers what she's up to and thwarts her plans by stating that if she wants a child, she'll have to have it with him.  They agree to a secret one-month reunion in order to make a baby.  What an eventful month it is!We also meet Rees' estranged brother Tom (notice how Rees is estranged from everyone in his life?) who happens to be a vicar, and Rees' mistress Lina, an opera singer whose only real remaining appeal for opera composer Rees is her voice (they stopped being lovers months ago).

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have a liked a little bit more detail.I read a recent review on here where someone said they were disappointed that Becks used Americanized language in the book.  He should know that there was a UK and a US version of this book released, hence the use of 'soccer' instead of 'football', etc.  The UK book is called 'David Beckham: My Side' and is written for the English audience.  I also questioned how much of the book was penned by David or the co-author Tom Watt.  I can't exactly see Becks sitting down to a computer and writing his memoirs.  But who cares - it was written from his point of view and I really enjoyed being able to get inside his head.I'd say the most interesting parts of the book were his rows with Alex Ferguson, leading to his eventual sale to Real Madrid and his feelings behind his sending off at the 1998 World Cup.

2.0,"A lot of people here and in the press seem to have been blown away by Jonathan Safran Foer's debut novel. I suspect I might have been also, had I read it first. But I came to it after his second novel,EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, which I frankly prefer. Both books are built around a similar search mechanism: a young man investigates a past calamity in order to discover what happened to an older relative. In this case, the hero is Foer himself; his quest is to find the woman who saved his grandfather, alone of his family, from the Nazis in the Ukraine. This is thus a Holocaust novel, though one of an unusual texture: a stylistic collage, brilliant and largely comedic. Foer has certainly found a new way to approach a much-visited subject.But while stimulating, I also found the book difficult to string together. Foer's range of technical devices may be smaller than in his second novel, but the narrative span is greater, stretching back beyond the Holocaust to the foundation of the shtetl in 1791. There is a similar manic humor, primarily due to a youngBorat-like translator, simultaneously boastful and naive, who becomes Foer's guide and literary correspondent; his fractured English is hilarious at first but soon wears thin. But the strange Yiddish folk idiom in which Foer himself records the history of the shtetl is scarcely easier to understand, mixing myth, parable, and fact in unpredictable ways. Indeed, with all the jumping between periods and voices, I fear I may still not have caught all the details that Foer finally discovers of his past. But -- and this is a big but -- the seriousness of the subject wins through in the end, and the revelations that really matter, by turns horrific and very moving, gain much of their power by putting humor to one side.Foer is certainly not alone in using a flamboyantly fractured style to explore the past: there is Nicole Krauss'THE HISTORY OF LOVE, Dara Horn'sTHE WORLD TO COME, Marina Lewycka'sA SHORT HISTORY OF TRACTORS IN UKRAINIAN, Kate Atkinson'sBEHIND THE SCENES AT THE MUSEUM, and just about anything by Salman Rushdie. But one influence that I don't see mentioned by commentators, yet is surely seminal, isCATCH 22by Joseph Heller, who was one of the first to employ absurdist comedy as a means of addressing the unspeakable.

3.0,"After the early death of her adventurous (and eccentric) Aunt Peg, Ginny embarks on a trans-Atlantic romp that brings her from London to Greece, Rome, Copenhagen (and back again) by way of instructions in thirteen envelopes written by Peg to recreate her own travels through Europe. Worried that her beloved niece has been too quiet and shy for far too long, Peg develops the envelope adventure as a way to bring Ginny to a totally new place -- and give her the ride of her life -- after she is no longer there to guide her into adulthood.I really enjoyed Maureen Johnson's 13 LITTLE BLUE ENVELOPES, though I felt as though there was a disconnect between Ginny and everyone around her. Because the book was told in third person and we weren't privy to Ginny's private thoughts, the book seemed to amble along and keep us totally separate from our main character. She seemed numb -- someone emotionally stunted. And after she meets boisterous and talented actor Keith in London, we only find out she's somehow interested in him through a letter she writes to her best friend . . . a person we never actually meet. It was just a whole lot of telling and not enough showing for my taste. At the end of the novel, I still felt like I didn't really knew Ginny at all.But that being said, I can't say I didn't like this book . . . I really did. I loved the glimpses of European cities, especially the ones I've visited, like London. Ginny's adventures in England were especially memorable, as was the friendship she strikes up with Richard, a man from Peg's past. Aunt Peg's letters were really interesting, and I found myself reading compulsively to see where they would guide her next. The characters she met along the way were fun.This was definitely an easy read -- I finished it fast. Perfect for a car or plane ride.

4.0,"You wouldn't think anything more could be written about crocheting, given it and knitting's increasing popularity in recent years, but there is always someone out there coming up with new ideas.  This book is for kids, and what I like about it is that it is broken up very well.  One stitch builds upon another, increasingly getting more complex, as the book goes on.  Each introduction of a new stitch is followed by several projects, which allows the budding, young crocheter to practice and, at the same time, produce something she or he can wear.  Kids get bored quickly, so this is a very good idea.<br /><br />There are good how-to, or process photos, and the projects are modern:  a water bottle cover and carrier, a &#34;Felted Phone Pocket,&#34; for example.  There is even a nice little spin on the inevitable scarf project.  It actually is one of the more complex designs, a long solid color with 2 colorful &#34;granny squares&#34; at each end.<br /><br />I have the praise whoever was responsible for including a boy in the photos of kids involved in the projects, too.

,"Wrote this review for the Livermore Public Library 2013 Summer Reading Program:Blow up a bridge. That is the mission assigned to Robert Jordan.Blow it up at at the perfect time for it to be blown up, and that time is not set... he must know when to do it, and he has to figure that out himself.This is how the story of Robert Jordan, an American Expatriot opens, in the midst of the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War. Hemingway does a great job setting the scene, describing just enough detail to put you there. He also manages to give you a nice taste of Spanish culture, and it's various attitudes.The Spaniard's love of seafood is featured in Pilar's description of Valencia, Spain is second only to Japan in seafood consumption.What is very interesting is the dialogue. Hemingway goes to great lengths to accurately translate the way Spaniards speak to each other with formality. There are a lot of Thee's and Thys, and the structure of the speech is a little difficult to get used to.It took me a while to understand why I kept reading things like \I have indescribable and unprintable and I have forgotten the obscenity password.\"" Indescribable",,and Robert Jordan,1.0

4.0,"This is the spoiler free review.I loved Divergent and Insurgent I've read both of them a few times.  I know that it isn't the strongest world building and some of the stuff is so far from real, but I like the spirit of the story so much I really let that go.  I enjoyed the idea factions and simulations and breaking out of your norms to be something more.Allegiant wasn't the book I hoped it would be.  Part of that is my fault of course for being so excited about it the other part is the direction the author took in the story.  It is a departure from some of the things I really loved in the first two books.  There is definitely not as much action in this one and some of the things that happened I thought were mistakes characters had already made in Insurgent and I thought they had already learned those lessons in a hard enough way they would not repeat them.That said the overall story is enjoyable I got to have some FourTris cuddle time and relationship development that I really liked.--  I fell in love with him.  But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me.  I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other.  I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.Seeing the world from both Tris's and Tobias's POV went well for me.  I knew Tobias was a flawed character so I wasn't surprised to see some of his struggles while others seemed a little off the mark.  There is a resolution of sorts with Caleb.  We get to see what is outside of the fence, it isn't at all what I thought it was.  Christina became a character I loved even more along with Cara.  There are new bad guys and new problems to deal with.  But the overall storyline just missed the mark with me a little.  It seemed a little like filler to get to the Big Event.I will say that the writing right before and after the Big Event is some of the best I've read from Roth and while I didn't like the direction the story took I respect that as the author that is where she chose to go and she at least wrote those parts beautifully.  The last 15% of the book is absolutely beautiful even if I didn't like where the story went.  But congrats to VR for doing something different with her story.My entire problem I think is that VR didn't make me believe in her ending.  I forgave some plot holes but the resolution between Evelyn and Tobias almost seemed like a cop out.  I did however like the arrangements between the Allegiant and Factionless at the ending.I will probably never read this one again even though Divergent is still one of my favorite books.  There is a definite ending and epilogue so we are not left hanging like in a few other dystopia trilogies I've read.Here is my silly math on how I came to my rating.  4 Stars for the commitment of the author to the ending she wanted, 1 Star for how I felt after finishing the book, 2.5 Stars for the overall outside the fence story line, and 5 stars for beautiful writing of the last 15% of the book.  (4+1+2.5+5)/4 = 3.125 so I'll just round down to 3 Stars total.If you would like to see my full review with spoilers please go to [...]",10/23/2013 0:00,Not What I Expected,3.0
,"Ms. Enoch is a truly talented author but her latest offering has fallen a bit short of what she normally provides her readers.  Overall this was your typical regency set romance.  What was not typical was the unlikable heroine Eleanor.I wanted to like Nell.  I truly did...but she came off as petulant, spoiled, and self serving.  These were just some of her finer qualities!  She wants one thing but ignores her inner voice when it tells her she is about to partake in a particular activity that perhaps she would be better off avoiding.  The fact that she does the exact thing (not thinking and acting like a twit at the ripe old age of 21) that her brothers were \protecting\"" her from does not increase her \""likeability factor\"" at all.  For the entirety of the read she \""wants\"" one thing but doesn't know what it is.  Okay.  But does she take time to figure out what that \""something\"" is?  The answer is no.Valentine on the other hand is your typical rake hero.  He lives a life that is well...rather colorful and he has no real use from woman (this is part of his past) and so when Eleanor's brother calls in a favor and asks Valentine to \""watch\"" over Nell to make sure that she doesn't bring scandal to the proper Griffin name",,60,

5.0,"When I read this book about 8 years ago it completely rocked my world.  Is it realistic?  No.  Does Rand over-simplify the world into mere black & white?  Yes.  Is it preachy?  Certainly.Now I can see how these aspects of it would turn off alot of readers, but I think the thing that still makes it a masterpiece is that it is such a unique outlook.  Howard Roark is the ideal hero of anyone who tries to swim against the stream in their art, business, etc.  His attitude is not one that you could live by on a day to day basis, and yet, it is a refreshing outlook because the creation is coming from within.Although Rand oversimplifies the good/evil dichotomy to the extreme, it still works in this book.  It is not trying to be the real world, and yet many of the things you see in this book will certainly remind you of the real world.There are certainly alot of Peter Keatings in the world.  People who are afraid to think for themselves, or take a stand.  Sadly we often knock down the visionary Roark's of our world.Anyways, read it for your self and see what you think.  This book is an inspiration to me and I've read it about 5 times.  It certainly has it's flaws (like Dominique), but all in all, if you like a good root for the underdog story, this is about as good as it gets.Also, from a literary standpoint I think it is pretty masterfully written.Howard Roark laughed.",02/14/2006 0:00,For the sake of art,5.0

11.0,"As I cracked open this book, it occurred to me that I had not read a new Tyrion chapter in over TEN YEARS. That's part of the problem.The first three books of this series were awesome. Martin set the bar very high.Book four was a disappointment, but only relative to the first three. In preparations for this fifth volume, I reread the first four. I was surprised by how much I liked the widely-panned book four. It's still Martin. It's still excellent. But the pace and story progress is much slower.Book five is a similar experience. There's good stuff here, but it's slow in coming. With upward of a dozen point-of-view characters, nobody's story moves particularly quickly.A lot of the criticism of this book is based upon expectations and frequency. If Martin released a book like this one every 12-18 months, most of his readers would be thrilled. It would be like a slow but steady march towards a conclusion. With a five year wait for book four and a six year wait for book five, the lack of progress is excruciating. It's like Stannis marching on Winterfell.There's not much of a solution to this problem, short of Martin putting more of his time into this series.

At times Foer's experimental ventures seem more imitative than original, but he never fails to simultaneously make one think deeply while being entertained.

The book starts off with Crichton in university and describes not only his experience as a medical student, but also how he blossumed into the successful author that he is! It was fate (and a bit of heritage...).But apart from his travels all over the world, it is fascinating to start reading about his experimentation with the pychic world and all. True, there is a bit of a &quot;I tried and tried and nothing seemed to happen, then suddenly it did&quot; air about his experiences, a vague cynical suspicion (on my behalf) that is sounded terribly like a 'growing up in California' experience, and one had to wonder, would Crichton have done what he did if he hadn't been so successful so young in life... But, the fact is he did, and as long as you are an open minded individual this book will be a very interesting read!If on the other hand, you are looking for a straightforward autobiographical account of rags to riches and writers angst of an amazingly successful and thoroughly readable author, you will be disappointed.

Ruled over by Her Divine Majesty Gloriana, Queen Elizabeth XXX, the Unity is defended by a mighty army and navy and also by the forces of the Magickal Arte, rediscovered five centuries ago by Leonardo of Vinci. Technology has stagnated, but the Arte has flourished under the control of the Church.Sir Rupert Triumff, lately returned from a mission of discovery in which he discovered a land named Australia, is a noted adventurer and consumer of alcohol. Curiously reluctant to make a formal report to the Queen about his newly-discovered continent, Triumff is soon drawn into an attempt to thwart a murky conspiracy with a most foul goal. For the safety of the country, Triumff has to go undercover, aided by allies unlikely and most redoubtable, as he attempts to discover who is planning to use sourcery most foul to endanger the life of the Queen...Triumff: Her Majesty's Hero is the first original adult novel by noted comics and Warhammer 40,000 author Dan Abnett. One of the launch titles for HarperCollins' new imprint, Angry Robot, Triumff is a flamboyant alternate-history story with elements of George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman books mixed together with a slice of Blackadder and left to simmer over the stove of Very Bad Puns.Abnett has created a rollicking world (neo-Elizabethanpunk?) which is basically a mash-up of our own and that of the Elizabethan period. Gentlemen fight duels of honour, but may choose to employ Swiss Army swords (which have an unfortunate habit of replacing the sword blade with a potato peeler at inopportune moments during combat) in lieu of a standard rapier. Firearms are around, but still relatively primitive, whilst those versed in the Arte may employ significantly more powerful magical weapons as well.Triumff himself is a splendid hero, a colourful man of action perhaps a little too fond of the bottle but generally out to do the right thing. Interestingly, whilst the central character he does not exist in a vacuum and a number of other major characters feature throughout the book, such as Mother Grundy the witchlock (independent witches and warlocks have been outlawed, but there's a loophole), Triumff's girlfriend Doll, a 'noble savage' named Uptil who is more than he seems and the book's narrator, Wllm Beaver, esq, a stalwart fellow whose assistance to our heroes is laudable but who also suffers from perspective confusion (unsure whether to refer to himself in the first or third person, and settles for both, to much hilarity).Events unfold at a rattling pace, although rather than charging straight through the reader is advised to savour the comical lines, the almost-missed references to movies and other stories and the increasing prevalence of puns, which at times arrive at such a velocity that they batter the reader's cultivated stoicism to such a degree that they must eventually surrender and find themselves laughing to references to a religious order named the Exeter Terrestrials and a young London musical artiste known as the Diseased Rascal.The book ends on a triumphant note with a promise that Sir Rupert Triumff will return for further adventures, which I find myself looking forwards to immensely.Triumff: Her Majesty's Hero (****) is a superior slice of amusement and is available now in the UK from Angry Robot.

,"I bought this in the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris of all places. This was the first and only I Heart book that I will be reading. I had so many problems with this book. Most importantly,  I had a hard time believing that the main character was a grown woman. She had the emotional intelligence and self esteem of the average twelve year old. I found Angela Clark to be really annoying and kind of sad. Perhaps suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness. Considering the physical fights, her insecurity, irresponsibility, and immaturity, this made for a frustrating read. The plot seemed really drawn out. Her relationship did not seem realistic at all.  How can you move in with a guy when you can't even talk to him about important matters in your relationship? I didn't find there to be a lot of Paris in this book either. I've been to Paris and I've read books that capture the city and this book does not. I'm so glad I didn't run into the \hipster\"" bars in the guide in the back of the book.

3.0,"An interesting read, though it has the feel of having been padded a bit, especially at the end when the author veers off into a mildly interesting but irrelevant mini-bio of the the son of the main character. I would rather she had spent more time clearly defining some of the financial shenanigans; I still am not clear on some very major points. I reread them several times, and perhaps they are just beyond me, but the rest of the book dragged because the author tried to build the story on what I thought were some shaky foundations. Perhaps if you're a stock-broket or banker it would be clearer. Also, the main actor in this drama, James Hazen Hyde, seems like such a pampered, spoiled child. Although Beard doesn't convert most of the sums involved into today's dollars, the one or two times that she does provides a basic formula; by that account, poor Mr. Hyde was worth approximately $50 million BEFORE his inheritance. Even if that figure is wrong by half, the letters he wrote to his mother wanting her to foot some of his bills are pretty pathetic.

I found myself wanting to fast forward to X's next chapter and see how she felt about this or that new development several times!As the title suggests, it's good sometimes to be reminded that human relations are rarely that simple - and each event can always be seen from more sides than one.The characters are generally well described, you in turn symphatize with each of them, especially in the more heartbreaking moments.Only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is that I was a little unsatisfied with the ending.

I think that even a bad Terry Prachett book is better than most books.Having said that, this is a lovely trilogy, well written and so simply that it causes the reader to forget about the writing and really hear what the characters are saying.This book is the third of the trilogy, but actually runs concurrently with the last half of the second book (Diggers).  It focuses on Masklin, Angelo, and Gurder's (from the first book Truckers) quest to reach Arnold Bros. (est. 1905) Grandson Richard, 39, which becomes the quest to call the nomes' Ship from outer space where it has been hidden for the last 15,000 years.  Along the way the deal with things like the nature of faith, truth, ethnocentrism, paradigm shifts and the chaos, frustration and fear that such a shift brings about, romance, love, and encouraging the object of affection to be all they can be rather than trying to trap them into small, manageable shadows of what they might have become. Pratchett even addresses that humans are probably crazy and probably lonely and that is why we have science fiction, and religion.In reading this review, I do make the story sound far busier and stuffier than is written...it is really just an adventure with a bit of romance thrown in. In any case, I recommend the entire trilogy.",06/30/2014 0:00,The Third of the Bromeliad Trilogy books,5.0

,"I'm a beginning brewer. This book came highly recommended by several websites and brewing forums. So I picked this book up.It's a thorough book and has been updated recently as the Introduction notes.Overall it was a good book for a beginner but there are some problems.First, the beginning chapters really barrel through the process so quickly that you're not sure what some of the terminology means.  For instance, Pitching.  Which is simply a brewer's word for dumping in the yeast.  You'll hear the term used through several chapters before you even have a clue what it means.  Another is sparging.  Which is another brewer's term for straining the spent finishing hops and other stuff out of the beer.As you can see I've read the entire book and I'm still uncertain of terms and when they are applied.  He finally explains those two previously mentioned phrases and many more in the latter half of the book but by that time I was already confused and asking myself what the heck do those words mean? So much so that I don't really think the meanings set in completely for the last half of the book.  This could just be my brain hiccupping (no pun intended) or maybe a flaw in the book.  You'd have to decide for yourself.  I finally noticed the Appendix in the back containing a glossary.  *Sigh*  oh well.Second, this is probably the most annoying part of the book for me.  He has a motto that he WAY overuses in the book.  Every few paragraphs he spouts off this silly motto.... \Relax. Don't worry. Have a homebrew\""Doesn't seem like much but after reading it about 200 times in the book I was tempted to black that stupid phrase with a marker.  For as many times as he had that in the book he could have put a quick glossary at the beginning to help us newbies to understand the terms he uses and doesn't explain until after he goes over the brewing process. Can you tell I despise that saying?Now to the good points of the book.The book is very thorough with some great recipes and knowledge about where beers come from and what kind is what as well as how they are made.  And how to make every single one of these brews.  It's an invaluable resource for recipes and little tips on homebrewing and some of the pitfalls. Giving many tips and tricks on how to avoid screwing up your first few batches.He also gives great explanations on the types of Hops",,74,

3.0,"This is an outstanding book.  It is part autobiography, part teaching manual, and each part is excellent.  Judith is a natural storyteller who can draw the reader effortlessly into the narrative of her life with each page leaving you wanting to go on to the next. Her story of her journey to integration and wholeness is really a universal one seen through the lens of her particular set of talents and experiences.  At a time when many people--indeed, in one sense all humanity--are struggling for a vision of the world that incorporates all of us, not just our physical or psychological natures, Judith's own path to find this vision has meaning and resonance for all of us.  Her autobiography alone would be worth the price of the book, but then she goes on to add several chapters of practical instruction, leavened with stories, on how a person can develop not just the psychic side of their nature but really their whole self.  As a teacher of paths into wholeness myself, I recognize and applaud what Judith has done here.  She has taken a subject around which there is much suspicion, fear and ridicule, and turned it into a blueprint for living in the everyday, natural fullness of one's life and capacities.  No &#34;woo-woo&#34; stuff here, but insights from a scientifically trained mind that has done the hard work of integrating the two sides of our nature, the material and the spiritual.  I thoroughly recommend this book as a valuable and excellent guide to wholeness.",08/28/2015 0:00,A Valuable and Excellent Guide to Wholeness,5.0

37.0,"Just when I had written off Kingsolver as a sentimental minor writer, she pulls off the Poisonwood Bible, a wonderful study of a missionary family which goes to Africa to redeem the primitives and are instead absorbed by  them.  Rev. Price is an egomaniacal man with a mission, a mission which  does not in anyway fit the people he has decided to save.  Even though he  is wrongheaded and fanatical, he remains a sympathetic, rather tragic  character, ultimately far more fragile than his wife and her four daughters  who mostly and in different styles manage to coexist and survive in Africa  through plagues, famines, and storms.  The Africans come across as entire  human beings for a change which makes the characters telling the story, the  mother (from a distance of many years) and the four daughters (concurrently  with their life in Africa) also more well-rounded.  Leah and Adah are  twins, one extroverted, the other so deeply introverted she does not talk,  Rachel is the crass materialistic egotistical daughter, while doomed Ruth  May actually seems to have a full life in Africa until she is bitten by a  mamba and becomes a spirit overlooking the living, like a mamba herself, an  invisible presence among the trees.  I read this book without putting it  down. Kingsolver also looks at the politics of the situation in Africa  which, first flayed by colonialism is then carved up, its wealth made off  with wholesale by the superpowers (especially the U.S. in its wrongheaded  righteous attempt to stamp out Communism while giving corporate predators  free rein), leaving the Africans to continue their endless struggle just to  get through one day at a time.

To add to the confusion, the book is replete with  typos that tend to show just how quickly this was made up at the printery.  The question remains:  who killed this little girl?  We may not like the  Ramseys or their values or their style of living, but there is no PROOF  that they caused the death of JonBenet.  Analysis of handwriting won't do  it.  Any defense lawyer would tear that to pieces.  Fingerprints and DNA on  the body won't prove anything either.  Forget about lie detector tests and  a neighbor who says he heard a scream in the night.  It is still possible  that someone outside the household came in, using one of the multitude of  housekeys that were floating about, and killed the girls for reasons yet  unknown. Without a confession there will never be a conviction in this  case.  Speculation may be interesting as a parlor game, but a jury is going  to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Mr. Schiller's book did not  bring the reader one step closer to the truth.  His previous books, some of  which were apparently assembled by a real writer, were masterpieces--but  not this one.",02/28/1999 0:00,Utter disappointment,1.0

It was something I&#8217;d been curious about since I read Divergent and they first started discussing it in passing. Well, my curiosity was finally satisfied, and I&#8217;m happy to say it was not at all what I was expecting.I also wasn&#8217;t expecting some of the twists & turns in Tris & Four&#8217;s relationship, but after Divergent it was clear that they&#8217;d always have their disagreements. I loved that because it makes their relationship seem more real. Relationships are not always easy, it&#8217;s not always flowers & picnics. People fight. Yes, the world as they know it is fracturing before they&#8217;re very eyes, and that is bound to put both of them on edge and make them more prone to fighting and disagreements. Major life tragedies can be very hard on couples. Imagine your country swallowed by civil war and finding out your whole world was a lie. That will put a strain on even the strongest bonds, I&#8217;m sure.While I loved seeing the continual evolvement of Tris & Four&#8217;s relationship, I didn&#8217;t love the supporting characters as much in this one. I found the supporting characters to be very well done in Divergent and outstanding in Insurgent, but there is just so much going on in the plot, the less awesome supporting cast is very easy to overlook.Speaking of the plot, the hardest thing in the world for me to read was that ending. I don&#8217;t even know the last time a book devastated me that much. Was it Laini Taylor&#8217;s Daughter of Smoke and Bone? Maybe. I think it might have been Melanie Rawn&#8217;s Skybowl.

1.0,"Most readers might wonder why a professional librarianship working tool like this list of subject headings could be of any interest or use to them. Well, it can be such if one has any interest in religious studies, Roman Catholic or otherwise. Lists of subject headings (or, to more limited extent, of descriptors) are a map of the grid of studies in any area. These subject headings, among other uses, can provide possible phrases to use in doing computer searches, or, in isolating key words within the subject headings, to use as descriptors for similar searches.  The complete U.S. Library of Congress subject headings list is an attempt to do this kind of thing for all aspects and areas of human knowledge; on that scale, obviously, such a work is by necessity sketchier than a list of subject headings, references, etc. would be for a particular subject, which a specialised list, such as &#34;Catholic Subject Headings&#34;, can map out in greater detail than any list can do that for all of knowledge and human endeavour. While it is true that any edition inexorably dates quickly for how libraries and abstracting services apply specific headings, which can change terminology and other factors over time, any edition at all of something like &#34;Catholic Subject Headings&#34; remains a valid outline of the subject and potentially a great help for anyone who needs the right vocabulary for searching a religious subject without prior knowledge of appropriate scholarly terminology, whether in subject bibliographies, specialised dictionaries and cyclopaedias, indexing and abstracting services (in print or digital form) and within book indices. The same applies to online searching of most kinds.  This particular list of subject headings is not limited to matters specifically Roman Catholic. It applies to Christianity and religion generally. &#34;Catholic Subject Headings&#34; can aid any religious scholar, sometimes greatly, to organise his use of terminology, to get an overviewof aspects large and small, and to have a grasp of to what religious studies amount. The cross-references, as well as the subject headings themselves, are very helpful in breaking out of any logjam that may block one's path through such studies by indicating alternative and parallel modes to approach similar subject matter and its terminology, by single words or in phrases, by means of the grid that together they provide.  So, in sum, this &#34;Catholic Subject Headings&#34;, in any of its editions, is a work admittedly of limited usefulness. However,  it also is one that can solve problems of a nature with which even dictionaries and encyclopaedias help in ways that are not always pertinent to a researcher's needs for the particular approach and terminology that a subject thesaurus like this subject lists lays out with such clarity.",08/29/2015 0:00,"However Dated Some Editions of This Work May Have Become, All of Them Remain Useful Tools and Guides to Researching Religion",4.0

They're not fast paced! There's hardly any good action scenes and gun battles, no Shoot 'em up lethal weapon stuff, which was what I expected yet didn't get it.  The only reason that people consider this book fast paced is because of the short chapters.  Yeah, I admit it, there are some very short chapters.  Lots.  But that doesn't mean that it's fast paced.  It's fast paced compared to Stephen King, but I think it's a slow paced book.  I want action.  I want adventure.  The killer kills a lot of people.  I didn't need disgusting and awful as well as dull details that James Patterson gives out.  And also, Patterson had a good chance to make this a good cop thriller.  He failed miserably.  I don't think I've ever read a good detective novel...all I want is a book with a bunch of action scenes.  If you think this is fast paced, good for you.

It is a worthy tract comparable (as some here have I believe) to Candide and Gullivers Travels (but on acid.)

3.0,"Yes, yes yes... so many of the reviews I read talked about how dark this book was. Maybe a few aspects but compared to many other books out there it is not very dark. There are constant references to the necessity of certain actions or expressions of regret. I think the main character should get harder as he ages but I am afraid the author will back down and make the prince obey his better nature which he clearly has. It seems this author is having second thoughts about creating a truly dark character who might even be called despicable.Evil is not always forced of necessity. Some choose it due to laziness, expedience, ignorance, or even enjoyment. The prince has a higher goal in mind almost from the start which practically forces the reader to give his actions the benefit of the doubt. Especially since very few are motivated by spite. A real human character that could lead a band of desperate outlaws might well have heroic or altruistic moments but his basic character would not contemplate 'saving the world' motivations as the prince does. Look at mafia leaders- ruthless killers often but compassionate with family(unless fearing betrayal) and outwardly compassionate to the neighborhood.Other than a nagging worry the author will turn the prince into the common heroic trope that abounds in fantasy the situations and story telling are good. Not incredibly gripping where the hours pass and suddenly its time to go to work but enjoyable.This first book sets the stage for what might be a very memorable character but there are signs this character will disappear into the mass of paper chain characters that inhabit fantasy bookshelves these days.",10/02/2011 0:00,Don't back down!,4.0

1.0,"What can one say, classic is a classic. It shows once and for all that SF isn't about high-tech gadgets, exploring strange new worlds in powerful vehicles or development of new physical theory trough something that is supposed to be fiction. It shows that SF is primarily about idea, about queer speculations of what if nature, about their usage and their consequences. Not every writer of SF (and there are many of them indeed) is capable of upholding this speculation on some higher level throughout the book, but those who are, like Le Guin here, are capable of creating powerful storylines which provoke imagination and intelect.There are various aspects of how this can be accomplished, some of them may contain much more philosophy then one would like in an SF book, but some of them are well balanced, combining the mystery, new-tech gadgets, and intellectual challenge in which one can immerse oneself. So, what's this book all about? It's a book about dreams, it's a metaphor gone real. In a world where dreams can take shapes, where dreaming isn't innocent as it is (but according to psychoanalists it never is innocent) in normal world, one's identity is brought into a question. Preservance of memory, important thing that has been infinite project throughout the history of humankind, now becomes the impossibility, and a man caught in the midst of it all, sure doesn't have a real good time. Apart from this it's a theoretical abstraction of practical building of utopian society, it's drawbacks and problems narrated in a sort of demented way which brings up the chaotic world of dreamer and his world. Starting idea of this book is interesting enough but philosophical background of it's character isn't on the level. Le Guin is to shallow and too insubstantial when battling different viewpoints, developing the political pragmatism against the eastern holism feels somewhat fake, and final outcome isn't satisfying enough. At least not for someone who isn't too kind to romantic politicism, and glorification of individualism.But, whether you agree with the ending of the book or you don't really isn't the point. Main thing here is the possibility of interpretation that this book provides in abundance while still keeping it's structural coherence. Le Guin managed to tell very interesting story of chaotic world in a chaotic manner that still somehow makes sense, and that, amongst other things is the real quality of this book. This is somewhat generalized saying, but Lathe of Heaven is the perfect example of how SF should be written.",12/05/2008 0:00,Somewhat vague,4.0

,"This is one of those massive, serious books you mean to read (to impress yourself as much as learn what's in it).  I have had it for years on my list, but never had the courage to crack it until recently.  Happily, once I started it, I simply could not put it down, even though it took me months to read.The situation in Spain in 1936, when the civil war began, was dauntingly complex.  On the right, there were the traditionalists, including monarchists, staunch catholics, industrialists, militarists seeking glory for Spain in Morocco, and various fascists and authoritarians opposed to the idea of a republic.  They were divided into a multitude of parties, factions, charismatic leaders, and simple brutes.  On the other side was a collection even more fractious of anarchists, communists, socialists, marxists, liberal democrats, atheists, and left-leaning regional liberation movements.  Caught somewhere in the middle were separatists in the Basque regions and Catalonia - the only industrialized regions of Spain - and the emerging middle classes.  This added up (perhaps) to more political parties than existed in Weimar Germany, along with Italy its coeval in poorly united nations that were seeking a clear identity in the 1920s.At this time, many of the old certainties were in precipitous decline due to local historical factors.  First, after the Inquisition and in spite of the many flowerings that sprung from the counter-Reformations (e.g. the Jesuits), the Catholic church had grown rigid and in many quarters was murderously despised.  It could offer no leadership and little comfort in the face of the upheavals that the republic was experiencing.  Second, the monarchy was decadent and incompetent, a shell that had been in decline since the apogee of the 17th C.  It too offered nothing to address the increasing chaos.  Third, the military was involved in a terribly costly colonial war, for some ill-defined glory of Spain, and was corrupted by bizarre notions of duty and privilege, embittered by lack of opportunity, and ignorant of the evolving society by its isolation.  The enlightenment, it seems, had never taken root in Spain, nor had the popular revolution as in France.The political configuration was similar to Weimar, a Parliamentary democracy that was unable to impose order or forge consensus, yet the country was for the most part appallingly poor and underdeveloped.  As the world fell into economic crisis - Spain was prosperous during WWI as a supplier not fighting - the tensions of both class and generational conflict were added to the ideological crisis, provoking the left (mostly anarchists at the time) into mob violence that reached unimaginable excesses:  churches were burned down, bourgeois were thrown off of cliffs, clerics murdered and raped, dignitaries and nuns were disinterred and mutilated, etc.  This rightly evoked horror among the traditionalists as society appeared to be completely breaking down; they found champions in the military, including Franco, who was a hero general in Morocco, and quickly moved into a leadership position.  Nonetheless, a dazzling array of social experiments were undertaken - money was abolished in some regions, collectives established that eliminated ruling elites and even managers, marriage was abolished in favor of free love and association, etc.  It is a reminder that the narrow social-political spectrum that exists today - capitalist democracy - is only one way that societies might have chosen to organize themselves, an entirely different trajectory on which to evolve; this alone is worth the price of admission.In 1936 in the name of order and traditional values, the military staged a country-wide coup, taking over about 2/5 of the country.  The opposition republicans occupied the N and E of the country, with all of the industry and most of the international legitimacy.  This is when Spain became a crucible testing ground for the battle of ideologies that culminated in WW II as well as military technology.  The fascist powers backed the military and Franco, providing aid and, crucially, highly trained personnel.  Not only did they test military strategies, refining among many techniques the Blitzkrieg (piercing lines with concentrations of tanks rather than using them as supporting supplements to infantry), but their men were \blooded\""",,muscling out other factions and applying brutal force against erstwhile allies.

5.0,"The Great Chasm takes Jesus' teachings on wealth and applies them to today's context in North America. Writing with a prophetic edge and a pastoral touch, Derek Engdahl, Servant Partners co-General Director, invites us into his journey of walking with the poor. While taking us into his own struggles in following Jesus, Derek offers new insights into Luke 15-16 that are useful to others who may want to teach on the passages of the The Lost Sheep, the Lost Coin, and the Lost Son, and, especially, The Shrewd Manager.  The book closes with practical steps for anyone (and any church) that wants to put Jesus' teachings into action.  Definitely a great tool for individuals and small groups.",08/28/2015 0:00,The Great Chasm takes Jesus' teachings on wealth and applies them ...,5.0

3.0,"I received a copy of this book from a friend who knows the author. I, like the author, love to travel and, like the author, prefer to set my daily itineraries loosely, starting with a basic plan and then just winging it. I therefore throughly enjoyed reading about the author's many unplanned adventures during his journey.<br /><br />Everyone, some earlier in life, some later, reaches the &#34;where now?&#34; stage and struggles to find answers. Whether in our professions, our relationships or even in our spirituality, wouldn't it be great to have some clear guidance, a proverbial road sign to lead us down the right path?  I knew a kid who was nine years old when he decided he was going to be a doctor and he never swayed from his childhood dream.<br /><br />But for most people it simply doesn't work that way. We need to grind through obstacles, highs and lows, sift through prejudice and our own upbringing, battle self-doubt and uncertainty before arriving at a place in our short lives where it is clear that, yes, this is where I need to be. And of course there are millions of people who never achieve this.  The author has found his path, his calling. And we see how he got there through his recollections and easy prose. What a ride!<br /><br />I agree with the previous review that one should definitely read carefully the heartfelt dedication to the author's father.  This 4-month trip, with the implied intention to see as much as the African continent, Asia and the Middle East as possible, was in fact a spiritual journey. I was very touched to read how the author followed his heart, his compass, and made and life-changing impact on people's lives.  Especially orphans.<br /><br />At the end, isn't it that what we are for? To make a positive impact on the lives of the people we love and create memories for them to pass on to their loved ones? But some people's True North doesn't end there. Like the author,  they need to give back to the universe, making a difference in the everyday lives of those less fortunate. I was very moved by his experiences and dedication to those poor children.<br /><br />Honestly, before reading this book I had very little interest in seeing the Africa. Having read True North, I am now convinced that's where I need to go next.",08/30/2015 0:00,like the author,5.0

1.0,"Lillian Bowman, an American heiress, is one of the four young women who call themselves the wallflowers.  In this second installment of the series, headstrong, spirited Lillian, her sister Daisy and her parents are attending a month long party held at Lord Westman's estate. Marcus, Lord Westman, is the ultimate in uptight, superior English snobbiness and Lillian cannot stand him.  Lillian and her sister need a sponsor to help them gain a husband from the English nobility and that sponsor comes in the form of Marcus's mother, a cold hearted woman who thinks preserving their bloodline is the most important thing her family can do.  After sneaking out to cause some mischief, Lillian runs into Marcus who loses his head and kisses her passionately.  Believing Marcus is bewitched by a secret ingredient in a perfume made just for her, Lillian enlists the other wallflowers to help in an experiment to see if the perfume has the same effect on all women.  Soon Lillian discovers there is more to Marcus than the facade he presents to the public and she wishes more than anything that she can have him, but she knows he will never marry an American no matter how rich.  Marcus is stunned to find himself so strongly affected by Miss Lillian Bowman, even in his affairs he has always been able to maintain a dignified presence but everytime he sees Lillian he loses all control....maybe even considering marriage.This was an amusing, fast paced sweet romance and I have hopes that the last two stories will compare to the first two in the series.  Marcus mother is the ultimate in cold hearted witches, and St. Vincent sufficiently wicked in his competition for Lillian.  St. Vincent will be featured in Evie's story which is the third and next book in this series.",09/11/2007 0:00,American Girl takes on British Nobility,5.0

He works within a minimalist framework, but he is not necessarily what I would call a minimalist. His poetry does something different than most of the mainstream: it provokes, annoys, and dances a lot.

For this one, Schreiber writes about a teen age girl who has always dreamed of becoming a vampire. So when a new mysterious family moves in to her boring town naturally rumors start flowing that they are a family of vampires. The heroian of the book tries to dispell the rumors for the town and herself but she cant stop wondering if it is possible that they may actually be vampires. In the end Schreiber leads us thinking that reality is exactly what it seems reality until of course she disproves it all and leaves us hungry for the second helping of Vampire Kisses.",01/28/2009 0:00,Cute,4.0

This was easy to read, not overly desciptive, which was a relief.  It did remind me of a book one might read in school, focusing on the use of symbolism, which was evident throughout.  Something which was sadly lost on one of the reviewers, and something which I thought was essential to understanding the novel and the main character Griet, was the submission, the violation of Griet, the girl with the pearl earring, by the painter Vermeer as he forced her to wear them, even putting them in her ears, painfully, himself.  This act would destroy Griet's position in the household, and change her world.  It mattered not whether she let another man take her after that, for she was already violated, permanently by the painter.  I realize this might be a confusing review.

45.0,"Every serious reader has had the experience: perhaps by accident --on a library shelf, or in a dusty box at a garage sale-- you stumble across an out-of-print book that seizes your imagination through its author's sheer mastery of the storytelling craft.And you wonder: why, O why, doesn't the publisher re-issue this in lieu of one or another of the emminently forgettable titles in current release?Such a book is THE LONG SHIPS by Frans Bengtssen, which crossed the Atlantic from Scandinavia to America in the early 1950s; like Leif Ericson, who made the same trip long before Columbus, this book lingered only briefly here before vanishing with scarcely a trace.And that is a tragedy for anyone who craves an epic, lusty tale of Vikings and their travels-- told with a sophisticated humor that is both wry and understated and with a sense of historical perspective that blends so subtly into the narrative that one is staggered to later find it is painstakingly accurate. Thank you, History Channel-- but I heard it all first, and far more compellingly, from following Orm Tostesson's exciting voyages, enthusiastic plunderings and thrilling adventures in THE LONG SHIPS.This book is a delight in every way: certainly, you can read simply for it for the lyrical use of language (it is, by the way, a translation from its original Swedish, and translator Michael Meyer deserves canonization for his masterful rendering of it into English). But it works well on so many other levels --as an action/adventure, or as a character-driven historical novel-- that to attempt to limit this book's sophisticated multi-layered appeal would be a disservice.The copy I obtained (with great difficulty; it's hard to track down THE LONG SHIPS, but well worth the effort when you do) was published by Collins of St. James' Place, London. I understand Random House holds the American rights.If there is any justice in the literary world --or wisdom left in today's publishing houses that is not measured with a cash register--  THE LONG SHIPS would immediately be reissued to a new generation of readers, to much fanfare from those of us who have already had the pleasure of reading it.--Earl Merkel(Author, FLU SEASON/THE FINAL EPIDEMIC and LIKE DISTANT CITIES BURNING, NAL/Penguin/Putnam, both scheduled for publication in Summer/Fall 2002.)",03/13/2002 0:00,Re-issue this book!!!,4.0

The doctors say there&#8217;s nothing medically wrong with her, so Sue is convinced that if she can find out why Charlotte did it, she can get Charlotte to wake up. There&#8217;s more to the story than Sue expects though.Why did Charlotte walk in front of a bus? And can Sue find out before it&#8217;s too late?This was an interesting mystery story, but I wasn&#8217;t very impressed with the ending.Sue was an okay character, but it wasn&#8217;t hard to think of her as delusional. I suppose that was part of the mystery &#8211; was she nuts or not? Was she imagining all these things that were happening? Was there more to Charlotte&#8217;s accident than everybody knew? But she did come across as bananas at points, and it really wasn&#8217;t difficult to question whether she needed psychiatric help.The storyline was okay, and I liked the mystery element, I liked finding out about Sue&#8217;s previous relationship with James and how she had ended up where she was, and I liked her investigation into her daughter&#8217;s life. It was also quite intriguing trying to find out how the two stories finally came together.The ending ruined this for me though. There were just too many questions left unanswered. Was Sue&#8217;s husband really up to something behind her back? And what became of Charlotte? Even though the question of James was tied up, we were still left with several things hanging, and although the interview with the author at the end of the book cleared one of those up, it wasn&#8217;t enough for me. I shouldn&#8217;t have to read the author interview at the end of the book to find out how it ended!Overall; good mystery story, but the ending spoilt it,6.5 out of 10.",04/29/2014 0:00,"good mystery story, but the ending spoilt it,",3.0

4.0,"Judging by the diversity of reviews, people out there tend to be polarised by this book Finite and Infinite Games (FIG).  After reading it, I can completely understand why.Reasons to hate FIG:Many of the points and especially the distinctions Carse makes seem to exist on a purely grammatical level.  Never mind grammar; sometimes the typeface alone suffices for Carse to make bold with meaning (i.e. italics).  &#8220;Whoever must play, cannot play.&#8221;Carse zooms off on many topical flights of fancy that seem more appropriate for New-Agey texts, such as sex, politics and environmentalism.  This book takes 180 pages but the essence of it could have been squeezed into about 80.  Maybe even a half dozen pages of diagrams or charts would have sufficed.FIGs structure apparently apes a classic text by Ludwig Wittgenstein, the twentieth century&#8217;s most significant philosopher.  In his &#8216;early&#8217; phase, Wittgenstein wrote the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in a numerically-structured fashion, reasoning from axiom to implications.  It was one of the most significant works of the time.  Carse seems to have Wittgenstein in mind as a model, as he mentions him overtly (p. 131) and contradicts him covertly (p. 108, &#8220;A world is not all that is the case&#8230;&#8221;).  For any philosopher to compare himself to Wittgenstein in this way is an embarrassment, unless he has won the Nobel Prize or equivalent.The style is dense and near aphoristic.  That&#8217;s fine if you are Nietzsche or Pascal and you make your meaning plainer elsewhere.  But FIG is all we have to inform and guide us on Carse&#8217;s thought.  We need more; more context, more proof of assumptions, more definitions.  None is forthcoming.As I glanced through the table on contents, I relished tackling some of the chapters.  I was hugely disappointed with their actual contents more than once.  &#8220;I Am the Genius of Myself&#8221;.  Excellent, sounds right up my alley.  But after reading the chapter, although it contained many powerful insights, I&#8217;m left none the wiser as to what my genius might be, or even what a genius is.The binding on this publication is pathetic.  As I read it, I was scared to open it fully in case it fell apart.Reasons to love FIG:Hooray, a book about games that doesn&#8217;t mention computers, MUDs or MMORGPS!Hooray, a book about games from a philosopher!  Philosophical books on the general subject of games, never mind philosophical books with a particular vision, are very thin on the ground.  Along with FIG, the only other equivalent I am currently aware of is Bernard Suits&#8217; &#8216;The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia&#8217;.Carse&#8217;s game metaphor &#8211; if metaphor it is &#8211; succeeds in offering a deep interpretation of two dichotomous worldviews.  These worldviews have been described by other disciplines in others ways e.g. egoism v altruism (ethics), competition v cooperation (economics), zero sum v non-zero sum (mathematics).  Carse&#8217;s finite v infinite model collects all these together under a larger analysis.What I take from Carse is that the game motif is not in fact a metaphor for our world but a literal description of what is going on.  How he explains common facts of life &#8211; rank, rules, titles, opponents &#8211; is a reversal of &#8216;gamification&#8217;.  He does not apply game elements to life but peels back the spn of seriosity to reveal the game elements in life.How to live as an &#8216;infinite gamer&#8217; is not to engage in a specific form of activity.  It is certainly not to engage in &#8220;playing at&#8221; (p.19) or &#8220;playing around&#8221; (p. 46).  This is perhaps what we usually label &#8216;fun&#8217; or what Carse calls &#8220;a harmless disregard for social constraints&#8221;, play with no consequence, play as entertainment, relaxation, amusement, diversion, and comic relief.  Carse is careful not to exclude these activities from infinite play as long as they are not identified with it.One of the ways to grasp what Carse means by infinite play is to contrast it to seriousness, something Carse does throughout the book.  For seriousness lies at the heart of finite play, and seriousness is not an emotional mood but a mindset.  Serious players identify themselves with a role and forbid themselves the freedom to act beyond it (sec. 13).  Serious players behave as if a part of a game &#8211; a role, an abstraction &#8211; is the whole game, as if there is a script to the game that must be obeyed, as if the rules come from outside own range of choice (sec. 14).  Seriousness is to demand fixed consequences and predicable outcomes; it is to exclude possibility and surprise.  It wants nothing more than play to end by winning (sec. 17).  Seriousness cannot experience life itself as joy and laughter (secs. 23-24).Connected to this portrayal of seriousness is Carse&#8217;s concept of masking or veiling.  To be &#8216;serious&#8217; means to be unwilling to drop the veil/mask that goes with a role and acknowledge that one has freely put it on.  Infinite players wear masks too, but they acknowledge to themselves and others that they are masked, that they are more than the mask, and that they could chose to put off that mask.  Infinite payers regard &#8220;each participant in finite play as that person playing and not as a role played by someone&#8221; (p. 18).  Hence, while finite play is &#8216;theatrical&#8217;, scripted, infinite play is &#8216;dramatic&#8217;, improvised, open, free.This review is becoming too serious, so I&#8217;d better stop.  I will come back to FIG again and again.  I will take its ideas, barely scratched here, into my own game of life.  I will have to chart its contents visually to earn a full grasp of them.  I will encourage my friends to read it and I will mention it in any relevant talks and lectures I give.  Therefore, for all these reasons, despite the real weaknesses listed, I chose to give it the full five points.",11/17/2013 0:00,Give the guy a break; he&#8217;s trying to start an infinite game here!,5.0

13.0,"I was completely blown away by this book. Back in high school I received an award for excellence in American History by a well-known national organization and I now realize that what I was taught in this arena was not the entire truth. I was stunned to read about Columbus' horrendous treatment of the American Indians after they welcomed him with open arms upon his arrival. Learning that our Government enacted the Sedition Act in 1791, allowing the Government to imprison anyone who spoke out against them, came as a complete surprise after I had been taught how important freedom of speech was supposed to be in the minds of our forefathers. (And yes, people were sent to jail under this act, too.)Abraham Lincoln, one of the most revered Presidents in our history, actually made public statements while running for office that talked about his belief in the supremacy of the white race. And his original Emancipation Proclamation, published four months before the one that became famous, offered to allow any Southern states who quit the Civil War and rejoined the Union to keep all of their slaves working for them exactly as they had become accustomed to before. It was only after none of the Southern states accepted this offer that Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation that we've come to know. (Zinn also talks about how the real reasons for the Civil War had more to do with economic disagreements between the North and South than it had to do with the subject of slavery.)In addition to this we learn how wealth and big business rule all and for the most part always have in our country. And we also learn how the media go along with the game, careful to not disrupt big business and the wealthy elite.Zinn has a great, easily readable style of writing, and he backs his words up with solid evidence based upon the records of whichever era he is describing at the time.This was a very interesting, eye-opening read for someone who has spent most of his adult life as a voting Republican!I am very, very grateful that I discovered and read this book.",08/26/2002 0:00,A Truly Amazing History Book,5.0
18.0,"It very well may be that I am not the right demographic for these novels--my 30ish sons turned me on to them originally--however, I am a voracious reader & can whip through these puppies in pretty short order.Not this one.Couldn't BEGIN to make sense of the geography (even with maps), constantly felt obliged to refer to the appendix in the back (which is not easy with a heavy hardback), finally gave up worrying about exactly which character whose name begins with 'A' was in reference...Here's what I *did* like (in general terms, no spoilers): the colorful disparities between the various peoples--Westeros, Ghiscari, Unsullied, etc., the Wall as a character in itself, the underpinnings of religious bigotry evidenced throughout.Problem is, there is nothing in DwD that advances these qualities past the previous books; in fact, DwD seems to take particular delight in an absurd level of...what? I just *don't know*! Wading through page after page with no pay-off. Why and wherefore? Boy, it *sure* is COLD!! Um, yeah.So, I cannot in good faith recommend it. But I do think the TV version will cure 99% of these ills. It's just not a great read.",10/23/2011 0:00,Little and less...,2.0
1.0,"First of all, there will be spoilers....I'm kind of on the fence as far as how I feel about this book. On the one hand, I loved it. I felt the story was good, although basically being a close copy of the Game Cube game Custom Robo (I wonder if anyone else felt that way). There are some differences, sure, but it's reasonably similar. On the flip side of that, this story had some gaping plot holes and had a lot of things that were very poorly thought out.Pros:Got to see what was outside the fenceMore information about Tris' momDelved deeper into Peter's mindsetetcThere are a fair few other reasons why I liked this book, though I don't care to list them all. The part about Peter was interesting: I liked that it showed him showing remorse and disgust for himself, it went further into how he was shown in Insurgent a bit. It led to him going so far as to fight Four for the sake of getting his mind wiped to change himself, something he admitted he wouldn't be able to do on his own. Alright, I can live with that. Actually, I can understand... It's very hard to change yourself, even more so without people around you constantly helping you, something I can relate to. Sure, he took the cheap way out, but it was a legitimate reason that I felt worked.Cons:Some died unnecessarilyCharacters behaved unlike themselvesThe ending was lackingetc.Now, when I say people died unnecessarily, I mean it. Have you ever read the Harry Potter series? How Mad-Eye dies more or less unnecessarily at the start of the 7th book? Yeah, that's how this one goes, except it is Tori that dies. I can buy that they'd get attacked, but she dies too easily for being someone that'd been that important in the first 2 books (a Dauntless leader, one of Tris' closest confidants). Then there's Uriah. He was another key character from the beginning as he was the one that got Tris involved with the pure Dauntless, those that were born there, and was also the one that always provided the much needed comic relief. What was his reason for dying? To provide Tris with fuel for her &#34;Listen to me, I'm usually right!&#34; fire and Four with major guilt at causing one of his best friends' brother to die. But the full negativity lies in how Tris dies.Let me start by saying I have no issues with her dying... I've got no problem when a main character dies so long as it serves a purpose and is well done. In this case, however, it wasn't. She gets shot trying to finish a mission rather than attacking the person holding her at gunpoint. Come on, this is Tris we're talking about... She's a smart chick even if she does let her emotions get the best of her sometime. Sure, the book doesn't give exact details as to how far David is from her when she enters the lab, or details as to the exact layout of the area, but what are the odds that this Dauntless legend, the only chick to be involved in almost every conflict since the story began, would have just dove at the memory serum to complete the mission without first figuring out how to increase her chances of success? If David would have shot her in the head on her run over toward the serum it'd have been over without her ever finishing it, end of story. Are we readers really expected to believe that she wouldn't have first thought about how to put some cover between the two of them or, better yet, tried to discern a way to get the gun from him without getting killed? Sure, she'd have likely been hit once or twice, but she'd have had a much higher chance of survival and Tris has long given up her reckless death seeking. She went into the death serum willingly, sure, but she had a point: she did have a chance at fighting it off as she was the only one known that could throw off every serum other than the highly concentrated fear serum.The death of Tris serves no purpose other than to give Four a reason to go zip lining for his first time and make him reconsider himself as he almost drinks memory serum to wipe his mind clean of all that happened. This is pathetic.Despite all the plot holes, the way the conflict in the city is resolved, and the pointless killing, part of me really likes this book. There was a certain draw to it that I'm not sure how to explain. I do feel the author rushed it a bit and didn't exactly do their best work (if Divergent and Insurgent are any indication), but I will likely read it again.",02/16/2014 0:00,"On the fence, this story can fall either way",3.0
0.0,"Released to tremendous critical acclaim, 'The Age of Wonder' is a mesmerizing journey through the rise and development of English science from the mid-18th century to mid-19th century. Since this coincided with the birth of Romantic poetry - mainly propelled by the likes of Coleridge, Shelley, Byron, Keats, Wordsworth et al - Holmes calls this era of science the era of 'Romantic' science. It is a fair description because apart from being closely attached to some of the aforementioned poets, the scientists of this era came to share the same sense of wonder and awe of the discoveries they were making as their literary counterparts.The narrative is anchored by one Sir Joseph Banks, whose influential 40+ year tenure as the president of the Royal Society saw the nurturing of such homegrown talent as Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday and immigrants such as the brother-sister duo of William and Caroline Herschel.We begin the book with a young Joseph Banks landing on the shores of island of Tahiti in 1769 as part of one of James Cook's legendary voyages. Tahiti was seen as Paradise by contemporary Europeans. Banks spent considerable time on that island fraternizing with the locals and eagerly learning their customs and their language. He returned to his native England a universally revered hero for bringing back riveting stories of new lands.From there Holmes spends each chapter describing new advances in the age in chemistry, astronomy, exploration of Africa, and (in a delightful chapter that dispenses a lot of arcana) ballooning.We learn about the Hanoverian immigrants William and Caroline Herschel who changed astronomy forever and almost instantaneously extended our notion of the universe with their home-made telescopes of great magnifying power. We learn about Mungo Park, the doomed Scottish explorer who died during his heroic exploration of Africa and sparked many a poems and lores. We learn about Rozier and the Montgolfier brothers and their balloons which captured the imagination of the French and the English.In each chapter Holmes combines letters, journals and contemporary reports to weave a gripping story. He takes us right to the place of the action and makes us feel emotionally (and physically) close to the main cast of characters. We feel we are right there with Davy and his young assistant Faraday during the tense months they spent inventing a new safety lamp for miners. We can see the new comets that Caroline Herschel saw through her seven-foot telescope.Holmes artfully closes the book by describing the rise of the new breed of scientists - John Herschel, Charles Darwin, Charles Babbage et al - and the aspirations and ambition they brought to the fore. I also enjoyed how he consciously highlighted the achievements of women scientists like Caroline Herschel (the first woman to ever receive a stipend from the King for her work as astronomer's assistant) and Mary Somerville.The reason I gave three stars to this well-researched book is Holmes tends to digress too much. It is clear he has in-depth knowledge of Romantic poetry but his constant infusion of the views of these poets becomes too distracting sometimes. Additionally, he has a tendency of ascribing intent and views to these poets and scientists where none might exist. This speculation is needless and often detracts from an otherwise fine narrative. He also focuses on minutiae sometimes which mars enjoyment of the book.But don't let these criticisms keep you from reading this fine, unique work. It is definitely a great experience if you can overlook the flaws I mentioned above.",05/03/2014 0:00,Fine and unique work that perhaps gets bogged down due to author's digressions,3.0

Herrnstein (who passed away before the book was published) and Murray set out to gather and present the data on intelligence and class structure, and ultimately let the facts speak for themselves.I don't disagree with the authors' conclusions. Our desperate need for equality in all things will no doubt keep this issue a heated one. My main critique of The Bell Curve is structural. The presentation of the material is monotonous, consisting of dry facts and dry charts. Kudos to the authors though for allowing the reader an out.

Other textbooks in BH give you assigned readings, but assume you have a Hebrew Bible with you. It's nice to actually have all the assignments included in the text. And it's good to have actual texts rather then non-connected sentences. You, of course, still get these non-connected sentences too. And the vocabulary expected to be learned in each lesson is very manageable.The grammar explanations can get a bit technical, but I've had no problems understanding them.

12.0,"After Black Ajax the idea of an essentially serious Fraser novel is a little less strange; when this came out, though, it was viewed as a definite anomaly in the middle of the Flashman series.  It's an excellent,  grown-up book that rings some interesting variations on classic western and  innocents-abroad archetypes-- in some ways the answer to H.L. Mencken's  famous jest that Henry James could have been a really great writer if only  he'd gone west instead of east to Europe.The straight-shootin'  ex-cowboy at the center of Mr. American is, for all his supposed outlaw  background, ultimately as much of an innocent as one of James' flowery  young debutantes.  Having made his pile out west (by means rough and tumble  but less vicious than all the Londoners like to imagine), he goes to Europe  to find refinement, culture, and-- he imagines-- the decency that life out  west lacked.  Of course he finds the exact opposite in an Edwardian England  that is morally rotten and on the verge of the greatest iniquity of all,  the mad self-destruction of World War I.  Fraser does a beautiful job of  making Mr. American simple enough to be disillusioned yet not so naive as  to be comical; this is a fine, intelligent read, and-- though this is  hardly the highest measure of a novel-- with its blend of John Ford and  Merchant Ivory, such perfect movie material that it's hard to imagine why  some aging star like Eastwood or Harrison Ford hasn't snapped it up and won  an Oscar with it.",06/23/2000 0:00,Remarkably good more or less serious Fraser novel,4.0

,"I must admit to having a mixed reaction to this book.  On the one hand, I like Borg's primary objective here in trying to help disenchanted and skeptical people rediscover their faith.  If someone simply can't believe in the exclusivity of grace through belief in Jesus, or in any one of a number of impossible-seeming miracles described in the Bible, I think it makes sense to point out alternative interpretations that might help get over those hurdles.  Borg plainly states that he isn't trying to disprove or contradict any certain belief, just trying to point out other possibilities that might help doubters reconnect with God and the Christian church.  If the book leads previously jaded and disenfranchised people back to having some relationship with God, then I think it must be counted as a positive influence.  On the other hand, much of this book seems to be focused on taking the miraculous out of Jesus' miracles, indeed taking the divinity out of Christ himself.By proposing a purely metaphorical interpretation of the Bible, I can't help feeling like Borg is creating a sort of \Christianity-lite\"".  Refuting the divine nature of Jesus",,unavoidably reduces the importance of Jesus.  If Jesus wasn't the Son of God,

1.0,"This breath of fresh air from Murphy comes at you like a hurricane to get your attention, has laughter tears running down your face page after page and zaps you with a reality punch that puts stars around your head like you see in the comics.<br /><br />Murphy gets your attention.<br /><br />This book is witty, thought provoking and beautifully written about a subject that is open to interpretation to anyone who wants to put their own spin on it—spiritual awakening. Fake gurus, beware.<br /><br />She plays with words to give us new ones such as MEmoirs, Manipulationships, and Me-jerk reactions  that make a point without getting preachy and holds your attention while she's talking about nebulous concepts such as awareness and awakening.<br /><br />Underpinning the humor is a truth we all need to grapple with. How much truth is in the books on the &#34;self help&#34; and &#34;spirituality&#34; shelves? Who's giving you the &#34;real skinny&#34; and who's just out to make a quick buck? Who walks their talk and who takes your money for a walk to their bank? (Murphy didn't say it in such a crass manner).<br /><br />With more and more people declaring that they are &#34;spiritual and not religious&#34; whose rule book do they follow? Do they need one? Who will win the &#34;feeding frenzy&#34; to be Number One in the Guru lineup.<br /><br />I found Lord Have Murphy to be thought provoking.

The &quot;Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft,&quot; is actually a remarkably well put together book that covers most of the major dimensions of the faith and religion and practice of Wicca.At first, I was worried this book would be yet another &quot;recipe book&quot; of spells, which it manages to keep to a bare minimum (though the cynic in me says that there is still more than enough of this approach in the book to appeal to the teeny-bopper 'I just want to do spells' crowd).Covering a variety of subjects within the grander scope of Wicca, including gems and crystals, herbs, Esbats, Sabbats, and the other basics and colourful parts of Wicca.  However, in this overview, some things weren't given enough time or emphasis: most notably the ethics of Wicca, which aren't so simple as to be worthy of only the most often quoted Rede's &quot;An it harm none, do as thou wilt.&quot;  Often glassed over by books on Wicca, the CIG does work with the ethics a little, but not as much as would be required in a book claiming to be a starter.I'd reccommend this book for those who've already gone through &quot;Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practicioner,&quot; by Scott Cunningham, for example, or for parents of youths who are wondering or questioning what their children are doing.

,"I've just finished reading THE BURGLAR ON THE PROWL, my third Lawrence Block book in the continuing adventures of master burglar, Bernie Rhodenbar. I have to say that I've enjoyed them all tremendously. The charactors are thoroughly enjoyable and the stories, though wildly improbable, are just too much fun to miss.Mr. Block writes in a style that is quick but deliberately paced, keeping those pages turning well into the evening. The characters are funny, sterotypical, completely predictable, and absolutely marvelous. That perhaps is the great charm of these books - they are like riding a roller coaster. You can see what's coming a mile away, you anticipate the plunges, dips, swerves and loops. You know they're coming, you're absolutely delighted as you go through them, and you are always satisfied with the result once you're done.Granted, these stories do not rise to the level of a really engaging John Le Carre, P.D. James or Collin Dexter mystery. Actually, they put me more in mind of a Lilian Jackson Braun \Cat\"" novel or a really funny episode of Monk on the television.

7.0,"This book on one of the most memorable Black performers from the studio period catches some of her vivacity--her mother is said to have given her youngest child a nickel on occasion to just stop singing, dancing and carrying on. The reader can't be sure that Mrs. McDaniel wasn't just trying to find a moment's peace or if she was attempting to dissuade her daughter from setting off on what she regarded as the primrose path. This bio does a good job of detailing her family's path from slavery to her role as one of the most visible representatives of her people to the average American in the '30s and '40s.Hattie McDaniel's ability to endure as well as her gift for imbuing her often subservient characters with much more edge than audiences were aware of at the time are delineated nicely in this biography. The author is remarkably thorough, mentioning Miss McDaniel's lifelong generosity to others, constant work to educate and make her industry more equitable, and even her participation in midget car races(Oh, where is the film of this?!)as well as her pioneering efforts to represent women, as well as Black Americans, as human beings. There is also some suggestion that Hattie McDaniel may have had to maneuver behind the scenes to maintain her preeminent position, though this is presented as indicative of the actress' savvy understanding of the inner workings of the Hollywood publicity machine.It's a little dry in parts, since the author, a professor of history, ascribes some conscious social and political motivations to this artist's early work that may be a bit hard to believe. Hattie McDaniel deserves to be recognized for her contributions, but sometimes, I suspect that like most of us, she did what she did in order to keep the wolf from the door.

It has Leonard's intimate understanding of the low-lifes in our society.But, none of those  qualities are excluded in any of Leonards novels.So what is the  matter?  You come to expect all those things going into reading Elmore  Leonard's books.  Either because he has been recommended to you, or you  have been a life long fan so you know what to expect.  But, this book is  still not the best of his bunch.Why? For one, it simply is not  memorable.Sure, the judge is a memorable character and a year from  now, if I try to explain this book to someone, Judge Gibbs will be the  central memory.  Of course the book is named after him, so he should  stand-out in this book. Yet, all the other characters lack a certain spark  that Leonard is known for.  Any of the other supporting characters could  wind up in his other books. It's almost like he is recycling old character  ideas from previous books.  Perhaps ones that never fit into another story,  but he liked them so much he blended them all into this book.Elmore  Leonard is pure guilty pleasure.  His books translate well into this era  because of his ear for speech, his heart-racing pace and his understanding  of the low-life in today's Jerry Springer/COPS society.  It's no wonder  than dozens of screen writers have emulated him in the past 20 years.  Its  not hard to see Leonard's influence in any of today's action/crime movies.You may enjoy &quot;Maximum Bob,&quot; as I did, but it won't be the  Leonard novel that you will savor and re-read at a later date.  3 stars  because it's still enjoyable, but not memorable.",07/01/2000 0:00,Not Altogether a Maximum Bore,3.0

This is, without a doubt, the best survivor/rescue story I've ever read (and I've read quite a few).First, the story just can't beat. A plane crashes in probably one of the most remote places on earth, the jungle highlands of New Guinea, at the end of WWII. Three survivors - two GIs and one WAC - somehow make it to a clearing in the valley below. There, they encounter natives who are basically living in the Stone Age and have never encountered anyone outside their narrow valley.

There, See almost seems  relieved to be able to abandon the pretense of writing an international  thriller and puts herself into the heads of regular people trying to walk  the survival tightrope in a changing China. This is good stuff. See writes  with confidence, and very quickly creates characters the reader can care  about.

0.0,"This book starts with the ending, so there is no mystery really. We all know that Jim Chee and Bernie are involved, that there is some danger, and that Chee and Bernie get married. We know all of this because we read about Joe Leaphorn meeting with some friends for coffee and they all discuss the story.Then comes the real story. I did not think that this novel is as good as the other Tony Hillerman books. Maybe it is because there are at least three intersecting story lines here and it is difficult to plot them in time in a linear format like a book; certainly there are portions of the story that repeat as each of the three (actually four if you think of Joe Leaphorn's involvement) learn about the background to this; also, as certain events take place, they are organized by person so there is a bit of timing issues where we come upon a scene either before or after others do, so it can be confusing.Added to this is that Joe Leaphorn plays a key role in the beginning of the story, but the just drops out of site completely, and several other clues appear to be forgotted and you have a bit of a disappointing story. The final thing that grated on me is that the novel takes place for the first time in the Grand Canyon and it appears to be a regular highway - with people popping in and out at random all over the place and immense coincidences helping resolve the plot as if they are commonplace - and the whole story leaves a bit of a sour taste in your mind.This is too bad as I read this book only weeks after Tony Hillerman's death. I do not know if this is the last book that he wrote about Chee and Leaphorn, but if it is, it is a sorry ending to a great series. I hope I'm wrong.",05/02/2009 0:00,Skeletal story,3.0

I don't mind fluff and that's what Gibson mostly gears toward and she excels at tongue-in-cheek, blase and quick beach reads, but I've read a few of her books that have had the goods so I know, when she puts her mind to it, she can produce an enjoyable, mostly well-rounded and always steamy contemporary romance that's still fun, but has memorable characters with some depth and not merely stereotypical caricatures.In See Jane Score, Gibson has turned me back on the upswing and I enjoyed this book in the always entertaining and fun Chinook world, which is #2 in the series. The love story of bad-boy goalie Luc Martineau, finally back in the game after an injury that had pretty much made people think he was down for the count, and smut-writer turned sports report Plain Jane but with potential Jane Alcott, kept me on my toes and had me wishing there'd been more.

Fast-flowing dialogue, hot sex scenes with a focus on their relationship too, and just enough characterization to make it plausible, it was worth the money.The only glitch for me was the proverbial 'wrench', i.e., the problem that helps to create tension and issues within the relationship, was semi-developed but lacking overall and sort of happens then glossed over and very rushed in the last chapter.

0.0,"Estelle is immersed in the latest erotica novel that is taking the world by storm.  Just when it is getting good, she hears her teenage son and is jolted back to reality.  Estelle returns her attention to closing out the day's receipts.  Estelle is the owner of the Crumbs Cafe.  After her divorce, she threw everything into her little bakery.  The winter months are always the hardest and the cafe is struggling.  Estelle decides to try and bring in business by hosting a book club.  At the first meeting there are five members.  The group has a discussion on Tess of the d'Urbervilles, but it is lacking enthusiasm.  At the end of the meeting, they are trying to pick their next read, Estelle was planning on Crime and Punishment, but the group doesn't seem to keen on another classic. As she roots around in her handbag trying to come up with an exciting read.  Her copy of Ten Lessons, the hot erotica novel she has been reading, falls out and the group leaps on it.  Soon the small book club is reading only erotic novels and learning a few new things about sex and relationships.  Can they put what the read to practical use?What I Liked:*First, don't let the title dissuade you from reading this book.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not a steamy, erotic read even though the book club's focus is on erotic books.  This is a terrific chick lit book with genuine characters and realistic situations.  The sex is a minimal aspect of the book, and when there is sex it is tastefully done.  I thought this was the perfect palate cleansing read.  I loved the characters, and I found myself immediately rooting for them.  I had a lot of fun with this book!*I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in the book club.  It is a small and eclectic bunch.  Estelle is the founder.  She is in her late forties, divorced, mother of a teenage son and owner of a small bakery.  Recently retired, Sue who is in her early sixties is quickly growing bored with retirement and discouraged that her husband doesn't want to get out and do things.  Rebecca has been married for a little over a year and she is disappointed that her sex life is in a rut.  Gracie a librarian with an amazing sense of style is nearing thirty and never been lucky in love.  Reggie rounds out the group.  He is also in his late twenties, working on his doctorate.  He joins the group to gain information on his thesis.  He is the only male in the group and at first, he is shy especially when the ladies decide to focus on erotic novels.  Quickly, the group becomes fast friends despite their age differences, and they are soon supporting each other and growing close.  I loved the dynamic in the group and I enjoyed watching the relationships form.  I grew to love each and every one of the characters.*I was a bit hesitant going into this knowing that the book club was going to focus on erotic reads.  Erotica is not my cup of tea.  I am just not a fan of detailed and explicit sex scenes in my reading, just a personal preference.  That being said, I was delighted to find that everything was handled tastefully.  I liked that even though the focus of the club was on erotic novels, the group made it educational.  They weren't reading the books for the smut value, they explored different erotic novels from all eras.  It was eye opening and interesting to learn about famous erotic novels of the past.  I thought the author did an exceptional job with the erotica.  This book shows how erotica has always been a part of reading and how it has evolved and changed over the centuries.  Fear not, all the discussions are tasteful and they don't sit around talking about the sex in explicit detail.*As the group begins to explore they erotica novels in the book club, they start finding uses for it in their own sex lives.  I liked seeing how each character took what they read and incorporated it into their lives.  It made some of them more bold and willing to try something new.  In the end, all of the characters learn something about themselves, their relationships and they all end up better people.  I loved the growth and changes in all the characters.The sex scenes are done just right.  For me, sex scenes are best when there is less detail.  The author provides enough information to give you the picture, and then she cuts out without going into the explicit details.  There aren't pages and pages of hot, steamy sex in this.  So if you are one who loves the sizzling sex scenes, you will be disappointed.  I personally thought they were well done.*I liked that the characters are diverse, different ages and in all types of relationships.  I think that most readers will find a character that they can relate to a bit.Even though the ending was a bit bitter sweet, I was so happy to see how far each of the members of the group had come during their time together.  I appreciated that the author provided a nice little Epilogue and everything ends happily.And The Not So Much:*I was a bit put off at first by Reggie.  I didn't think a male had a place in The Naughty Girl's Book Club.  I was expecting the group to be all female because of the title.  When Reggie first shows up, he makes it clear he is there to gather research for his thesis.  He is shy and doesn't actively participate.  I kept hoping that he would give up on the book club, especially when they started reading erotica.  However as time went on, he begins to open up and he starts adding to the discussion.  After that, I enjoyed watching how the book club gave him new confidence.  He ended up being a great addition to the book club.*Sue was the hardest character for me to relate to.  She is in her early sixties and struggling with retirement.  She is already missing her busy life and disappointed that her husband has no interest in doing anything other than puttering around at home.  Her sex life has never been satisfying and she soon learns what she has been missing once she starts reading all the erotica.  Sue's parts of the book are the most negative as she and her husband start fighting.  It gets worse and worse, and I didn't like that her parts dragged down the story.  I was grateful that things finally ended on a high note for Sue, and I ended up appreciating her journey.*The ending is a bittersweet.  I was a touch disappointed that after everything the group had gone through that due to circumstances, things began to rapidly change.  I kind of hated seeing the changes.  I appreciated though that the Epilogue wraps everything up and ties up the loose ends.The Naughty Girls' Book Club was a surprisingly good read.  I loved that this was a book with genuine characters in realistic situations.  I enjoyed exploring the relationships and seeing the characters transform.  I appreciated that this was an educational read as well and I learned a lot about how erotic books have changed throughout the centuries.  The sex is tasteful and lacks explicit detail.  Bottom line this is a feel good chick lit read perfect for when you need something light and fun.Favorite Quotations:&#34;All the best books should be shared and discussed and debated.  It's a centuries' old tradition.  People have always loved stories.&#34;I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

1.0,"Set during the Spanish American War of the 1930s, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel about an American sent on a mission to help guerrilla fighters blow up a bridge.There. That's the basic plot. It sounds like something out a an action movie, doesn't it. To stop there, however, would be doing the novel and the author a grave disservice.When it gets down to it, For Whom the Bell Tolls is about death and how to face it. The men on this secret bridge-exploding mission are going to die, and they know it. They will not be coming back from this mission. Each of them will be facing death one way or another, and they each have to deal with it individually. The idea of suicide is even approached from a soldier's point of view; the question is raised, is it preferable to kill oneself than to be captured by the enemy?For Whom the Bell Tolls also touches upon racism and politics, though not strictly from an American point of view.Within this tale, violence is to be found in spades, but this is not a simple action story. This is true literature, told in the best writing Hemingway ever did (yes, I admit that's arguable, but it's my opinion ... believe what you want).As a writer, is there anything not to learn from Hemingway? The man knew how to write tense scenes and deal with weighty subject matters all while using as few words as possible, and most of those short words. No other author in my experience has quite been able to do that.As an aside, I'll admit that every time I read a Hemingway novel, I always hate it. Until I reach the very last page. Then suddenly I love it. Not sure why that is, but it's always been my reaction.",11/07/2010 0:00,Hemingway at his best,4.0

201.0,"I have mixed feelings about this program, having followed it for three months now.  I don't regret the purchase, and on the whole, it's a great book.  It even performed a few miracles.  But Jorge's book has a lot of room for improvement.First of all, it seems to be aimed at those who only have about 10-20lbs to lose.  This is made evident both by the pictures in the book and the occasional comment that shows complete misunderstanding or insensitivity to serious obesity.  Some of the exercises themselves are not even possible for a very overweight person to perform, and Jorge never gives alternatives.  Secondly, Jorge's &quot;motivational&quot; tips each morning are, by and large, either insultingly stupid, or so absurd as to make you look forward to them each morning just for the dose of mocking laughter.  Third, a month is simply not enough time to see tremendous progress in the body.  Thus, the measurements and photographs that he makes you take at the beginning and the end can be very depressing, even if you're successful.  Finally, I've found that the program's success is very precarious.  I lost six pounds the first month, following it religiously -- less than the 2lb a week average.  During the second and third month, a single day's variation from the food program erased an entire two week's worth of progress.  (This is disappointing, since one cannot always avoid the occasional dinner party or other situation in which meal choices are not within your control and a little checkbook of food boxes would be embarrassing and inappropriate.)All that said, the book did, as I mentioned, perform a few miracles.  The first miracle was that it got my husband exercising with me.  He agreed that if we couldn't devote eight minutes a day then we would never succeed at any exercise program.  It will never get easier than this.  The second miracle was that my muscle strength has improved tremendously.  Though my weight loss achievements on this program have not been overly impressive, the fact that I started at a point where I could barely lift a five pound weight, and am now strongly and confidently wielding the fifteen pound weights and needing heavier ones is very impressive indeed.  It's made me healthier, stronger, and more energetic.  And the exercise regimen, spending a few minutes each morning doing these routines, is something I believe I can maintain.All in all, I think Jorge has done a great thing here, and I value his book enough that I use it every morning, and likely will continue to do so.  Kudos to him, and I look forward to the next one.",12/28/2001 0:00,Mixed Feelings,3.0

That is, believe it or not, the very first piece of information that appears in this book (if you disregard the cover!).This is not the first version of this book, which has previously been critically-acclaimed, but it has undergone a total, major revision in the process. With a book of this size that must be no mean feat. Despite being such a comprehensive book the overall style is a mixture of friendly/informative. The description given for the first chapter &#8220;Kitchen Basics&#8221; probably says it all. &#8220;What do you need to know &#8211; and own &#8211; to make great meals? Not much.&#8221; After 20 pages of condensed, important information that gives you an intense primer about equipment, knives, ovenware, cutting meat and other knife skills and 11 essential cooking techniques you get to the recipes.Even here you are not just thrown into the deep as you get to the chapters: sauces, condiments, herbs and spices; appetisers; soups; sandwiches and pizza; salads; vegetables and fruits; beans; grains; pasta, noodles and dumplings; fish and shellfish; poultry; meat; eggs, breakfast and dairy; bread and desserts. Each chapter is structured and features a lot of associated information to inform and educate as you go along.The recipes appear simple to follow and are structured in a very pleasing manner. First you get a typical serving size, an approximation of time (prep and cook, hurrah!), a little overview, ingredients list, very detailed instructions and then even various customisation tips and suggestions as relevant.The author even finds space to give suggested menus, a list of the author&#8217;s 102 essential recipes, 100 top fast recipes, 100 top make-ahead recipes, 100 top vegetarian recipes, various further reading resources and an index that is bursting at the seems with its information. Probably all but the kitchen sink, or that is how it feels.This is not one of those low cost, tightly-printed, 1000 recipes for five dollar-type books. It is a bulky, considerable resource that will probably last you a lifetime. You may consider it one of the foundation pillars of your kitchen or library. Whilst you could survive with just one cookbook (of this kind) it will probably inspire you to cook more and more, explore different ingredients and cuisine genres&#8230; and invariably buy more books along the way.",02/26/2013 0:00,A good book,5.0

During most of the book (90% to be honest) i was furious with the heroine and hero. Hes a man whore, shes the dog he pushes around. She watches, and hears him having sex with his wife on one page and on the next shes having sex with him(although what else can a home wrecker expect?) The story is just not believable. He hates his wife, then he wants and loves her? He chases after alys then he forgets her. A lot of weird s&m stuff, a threesome that made me gag, and plenty of rape. Then theres the wax dolls...and the wax miscarriage. Like i said, unbelievable and gross! But mostly gross. If you have never read this author chose another book(they all have man whores though).

0.0,"It's obvious from the very early pages of Spellwright that Blake Charlton is a child of late-eighties and early-nineties Fantasy. It's full of dastardly villains, righteous youths and hidden destinies. Like contemporaries Brandon Sanderson and Peter V. Brett, Charlton is doing his damnedest to bring back the type of fantasy where the good guys are good, and the bad guys are bad (barring a few genuinely surprising twists in the final pages) and the fate of the world's at risk of being overrun by demon hordes.And that's not where the comparisons to Brett and Sanderson end. Both of those novelists are known for their intricate, imaginative magic systems, which are not only cool spectacles and a catalyst for visceral battle scenes, but also intimately woven into the plot and world of their stories, and Charlton's work is no different. Spellwriting, which gives the caster the ability to `write' complex magical formulas-much like a computer programming language-and manifest nearly anything they can think of (including cognizant, living spells called constructs and golems), is at the centre of Charlton's story, with the main hook being that the protagonist, Nicodemus Weal (who was once thought to be a hero from prophecy) is a cacographer, a dyslexic Spellwright who can neither write his own spells nor come in contact with another's spell without causing disastrous results.The history of this character's disability can be traced directly back to Charlton's own struggles growing up with severe dyslexia, and this gives a real weight to Weal's struggles, as one might consider the novel to have a semi-autobiographical nature, though surely Charlton never had to face the idea that only his disability was standing in the way of saving the world from certain doom. Spellwriting and Weal's struggle to come to terms with his disability are certainly the meat of the story, given the generic overall plot of the novel (demons are bad, want to take over the world, et al.), and for the most part gives the reader a compelling reason to stick with the novel.This all comes at a price, though. Unlike Sanderson's and Brett's magic systems, Spellwriting requires a heavy does of explanation to give the reader enough of a basic understanding of the system, and much of the early part of the novel is full of jargon and long conversations between various Spellwrights as they explain to each other concepts that they (but not the reader) should be more than familiar with.The result is that Charlton's magic system,with its almost mathematically logical underlying ruleset, does not weave itself into the story as naturally as that of Sanderson or Brett, and some effort must be made by the reader to understand the nuances of Spellwriting. Still, once the reader is comfortable, it shows its depth and the Charlton's storytelling really begins to take advantage of Weal's disability. We so often see the illiterate boy whisked off his farm and turned into a magical savant within pages, so it's nice to see a young man (Weal is twenty-fiveish) who is raised in a breadbasket of magic, but struggles mightily with with his powers and the expectations thrust upon him by others. One might assume that, with the rules of the magic system laid out in Spellwright, the the two sequels will flow more organically as Charlton shifts focus from setting up the magic system and the world to telling the overarching story.Speaking of which, world-building and setting are light in Spellwright, with most of the novel taking place in the confines of Starhaven a magical academy for Spellwrights, but with a more grown-up, academical air than Harry Potter`s Hogwarts, and a shadowy, ancient history not unlike that established for Green Angel Tower in Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy. Though ostensibly an Epic Fantasy from the outside, Spellwright`s narrow setting, intimate plot and tight cast of characters reminds one of classic Sword & Sorcery novels, including James Enge`s recent novel,Blood of Ambrose(minus the foreskin jokes, of course).Spellwright moves along at a decent clip, thanks to short chapters and breezy dialogue. I'm generally a fan of short chapters, but there were a few instances where it seemed like Charlton artificially chopped a chapter off, in the middle of a scene, leading to an odd feeling of transition when the next chapter picks up, literally, a word away from where the previous one left off. The pace is also dampened now and then by infodumps, generally doled out through the aforementioned conversation between characters (again, often relaying information that should already be common knowledge to the two speaking). But, still, Charlton's writing improves chapter on chapter, and by the final third I was having a damn hard time putting it down. The final chapter, just before the ominous epilogue, was particularly satisfying and sets up the next volume in interesting ways.Charlton might not win over the Abercrombie/Martin/Lynch crowd, but there's certainly something there for fans of you-know-who-to-root-for Fantasy, and those who grew up on Brooks, Williams and Feist will certainly find a lot to like about Spellwright. Though not perfect, Charlton's inventive debut is comfortable in its tropes, but also willing to turn convention on its head and remind us of that sense of wonder than drew us to Fantasy in the first place.",05/26/2011 0:00,A solid throw-back to 80s Fantasy,4.0

I just finished &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and I cannot believe this is the same person who penned  &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; or &quot;We the Living&quot;.I think the main  problem is that she's struggling to incorporate a more formal version of  her philosophy into a fiction work.

None of the characters are  appealing.  The plot is uneven - it lurches forward only to stagnate for  dozens of pages.  The overall tone of the book was depressing and venomous  to no apparent purpose, thematic or otherwise.Worst of all, some of  the action was just competely unbelievable.  For instance: Roark taking on  the housing project that sets up the final conflict in the novel was a  transparent plot device.  It didn't seem to be something he would do -  either philosophically or from common sense. Why would he trust the people  he trusts in taking on that project?I pushed through to the end, but I  was so happy when the novel was over.  Worst of all, I really don't think  Rand succeeded in presenting Objectivism or an exalted sense of life.

In my opinion it was well written and followed the story line. Sad, yes, but bad writing? No. What people Don't understand is this was a DIS-utopian society. The tragic ending was implied. Her death did come as a shock to me as I had expected Tobias to be the victim, but the twist added something special. It was well written as said above and I was shaking my head at the end wondering why I had not expected it. Her death made this book different from the terribly written series, the hunger games (Not the first, but definitely the last two). In this book you are not screaming for satisfaction. In the hunger games it  was as if katniss was just dealing with the life she was left with. In this book you feel Tobias' s pain, but you also see him moving on.I gave this book three stars because the writing ( up to the climax) was average. Tobias was a weak character and nothing like four In the first books. At times I couldn't see the difference between his pov and the pov of Tris. Also I felt as though the setting of the outside world was made by a child. Little detail was given as to why the genetics of people were changed. Also the US government is mentioned, but never explained. Crime is everywhere to the point there is no safe place to live, yet there is a government. This altered the story from a dis-utopia to a post apocalyptic world.In conclusion while I thought the ending left me settled and was a good wrap up to this story the explanation of the world along with the weak writing made this an overall average read.",11/28/2013 0:00,"Neat ending, weak-writing",3.0

,"Stacey gave me this book last year for Christmas. It is written by Simon Winchester, who also wrote The Professor and the Madman, which was a fascinating book about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. This story was a bit more challenging to get through. I did learn many interesting things, but the topic was just not as thrilling, nor was the story or the telling as compelling. And clearly the title engages in hyperbole. Not entirely sure I can reccomend this book in general, perhaps if your really into geology.One interesting fact: the largest division of time is eon, of which there have been four, the current being the Phanerozoic, which means \visible life\"". The division goes from eon",,6,

I think about the bounty to which I am so privileged every time I walk into a grocery store.  I often think of the villagers' lack of transportation when we complain about the price of gas for our luxury cars.  I think about the missionaries who just wanted to do something good, and how they thought  the solution for food would be as simple as planting seeds.  The seeds grow into unruly gnarled plants which intensify the already dark jungle.  Cattle...why don't they just get some cattle?  Tsetse flies kill them!  Instead of the missionaries from America teaching the villagers  how to live, the villagers taught the missionaries how to survive.  I've read other books and articles written by scholars on the politics of the Congo at that time, and it seems Mrs. Kingsolver has masterfully researched this aspect as well.This is a book that will be talked about half a century from now, and that would, I believe, make it a classic!

The heroine is Elizabeth Lee who by all accounts is very strait laced and not interested in marriage or such.  But she used to be and was her by a man and has went to setting herself up as a leader of women and their rights. Which is way she is on the same ship as our hero, Scotsman Kincade MacKay..who is the total different in every way. They first meet with Kincade sneaking into her room thinking she was the women he set up a late night &#34;meeting&#34; with. Which startles her and she starts to yell and that leads to Kincade being put into the 'hold'. This leads Elizabeth going the next day to claim he is a cousin to help get him out... this starts the story and continues to the drama of them ship wrecking and how they come to being together.

493.0,"I read a lot.  I read a lot of fiction, non fiction, classics, literature, manuals, blah, blah, blah.  I own thousands of books.  when i was younger I would read a book through no matter how bad, as I have gotten older and had more demands on my time, I've realised the folly in this so gladly toss aside a book that is worthless and shun authors who have disappointed me too often.I might read Winds of Winter if it comes out and if I have not decided to read something else at the time.  I enjoyed a Game a Thrones and a Clash of Kings and a Storm of Swords.  I slogged through Feast but could not re-read it.  I struggled through Dance and will not waste time re-reading it.  I could give a synopsis of this 959 page book in less than 5000 words and none of them would be used describing the menu or the wine or the beer.This series suffers from the lack of a decent editor who would look at the pages and cut them by 75% and tell Martin to tighten things up, to get to the story, to dispense with tricks and cliff hangers and, again, get to the story.Feast showed us the story had gotten away from Martin.  Dance shows us he is still not sure what to do, where to go, how to proceed.  Both Feast and Dance could have been combined, as was originally planned, into one book and that book could have been less than 500 pages and we would have cried out for more rather than plodding through a tired replay of feasts and argument and schemes we've seen many too many times before.A good editor would have kept Martin focused on the story but editors lose the spine when an author becomes popular and they let any old POS get published as long as there is a ready audience to snap it up and cry for more.I came to the series late.  I got Game and Clash for $4 as single book.  I bought Storm for $6ish, I believe I paid $12ish for Feast and I pro-ordered Dance for around $15.  My initial $10 investment was sound.  My later $27 was not.Others have said, nothing happens in this book.  I disagree.  We get about 100 pages of story.  The problem is that there are 959 pages in the book and teasing the story from these pages is tiresome work.",07/14/2011 0:00,More menu than Dance,3.0

7.0,"`Writing at the Kitchen Table' is the `Authorized Biography of Elizabeth David' by Artemis Cooper. Biographer Cooper, by great sympathy with his subject, with access to great sources, and by superior narrative has given us a superior biography of one of the three great female English language culinary writers of the twentieth century.It is revealing to compare the lives and careers of Ms. David with the other two greats, Julia Child and M.F.K. Fisher. She stands roughly between Child, the great teacher and Fisher, the great gourmand and explorer of appetites. Her recipe writing was less pedagogical and more analytical than Child, and less subjective but more attentive to details of other peoples works than Fisher.In their personal lives, it is interesting to see that while David and Fisher were certifiably beautiful women through much of their lives, their success with husbands was poor to dismal by the standards of their day and ours. In contrast, the very tall and warbly voiced Julia Child was attractive by the same standards one may have used with Eleanor Roosevelt, yet her family life with husband, Paul Child was one of the world's great enduring love stories.A fascinating parallel with Child and David is that they both served in their country's intelligence organizations overseas during World War II. While Child was with the OSS in India and Burma, David was with British Intelligence in Cairo, where she landed at the beginning of the war after a literally hair raising flight from the Italians and Germans in 1940, across the Mediterranean just as the Germans were invading Greece. Also, Ms. Child and Ms. David both met their future husbands during the war.One small problem I have with the biographies of both Ms. David and Ms. Fisher is that neither does a really good job of identify the spark that ignited their interest in food. Unlike these two, Julia Child's epiphany is obvious when she found herself with a husband who liked to eat well, and she did not really know how to cook. Necessity took over and Julia dove into the subject with what became a lifelong passion.With Elizabeth David, the interest seems to creep up on her as a result of really dismal food in her nursery as a child, followed by the revelation of very good food while living and studying in Paris and Munich. While Ms. Fisher started writing before World War II, Ms. Child and Ms. David both started their careers around 1950, although Ms. David was first published `Mediterranean Food' seven years before Julia Child et al's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. In fact, by 1962, after publishing `French Provincial Food' and `Italian Food', Ms. David was quite the authority compared to newcomer Child.This is another interesting parallel in that the most famous works from all three authors came early in their careers. While Ms. Fisher's greatest fame came in the 1960's, it was largely based on reissues of works she did in the 1940s. And, neither Ms. Child nor Ms. David ever topped the popularity of the works in their first five years.Oddly, Elizabeth David's very best work of scholarship was probably published near the end of her career, and it is probably her least known major work. This is `English Bread and Yeast Cookery', which lead to her achieving her highest official recognition's from the Crown and from English intellectual society. What is surprising is that this great scholarly work may have as much in common with Rachael Carson's `Silent Spring' as it does with Peter Reinhart's books on bread baking. Along with great information on home and commercial practice, it was a revelation of how poor English commercial bread baking could be.In addition to her unfortunate romantic live and her James Bondean experiences at the opening of World War II, Ms. David's life in general seems to have been less happy than that of Ms. Fisher and far less happy than the `too good to be believed' life of Ms. Child. Ms. David's father died young and her mother did not have a great deal of interest in her four daughters. Early in life, Elizabeth made up for her family's alienation by living beyond her means, with the knowledge that her family's estate would bail her out of her debts.Her relations with her family and many friends seemed to be perpetually bumpy. Elizabeth could be both very reserved and very prickly, with a blindness to seeing the other point of view in a lot of cases, leading to more than one very long term alienation from former friends. She was, for example, very difficult to interview and had a great aversion to seeing her name in print in contexts other than as author of her own works.Her business dealings tended to the difficult as well, although not entirely through her doing. Her relations with publishers of books and magazines seemed to be especially difficult, leading to serious legal entanglements. Her problems with the cookware store, `Elizabeth David, LTD', of which she was just one of five shareholders were largely her own doing, as she ignored good business sense and ran things largely to suit her personal tastes. Then, she took serious offense when her business partners brought in a manager with good marketing skills.While Elizabeth David's influence was not great in the United States, it did have a great effect on the general direction of American cuisine in her friendship with American expatriate, Richard Olney and their joint influence on Chez Panisse movers and shakers, Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower, plus the tiny San Francisco eatery, Zuni Caf&eacute;, soon to be the second best known San Francisco eatery, after Panisse.This book was more enjoyable to read than the recent Fisher biography, `Poet of the Appetites', but not quite as much fun as the Child biography, `Appetite for Life'.If you consider yourself a card-carrying foodie, you should read this book.",07/20/2005 0:00,"Very Good Biography, Very Important Culinary Writer",5.0

6.0,For instance we learn that Nicholson was taught acting by veteran film and tv actor Jeff Corey. It gives a little vague when it describes exactly what kind of actor Nicholson is. Corey mostly taught Nicholson method acting but for some films like The Shining Nicholson was more old fashioned theatrically in his approach. We learn many more things about JN like that that Nicholson gave up being an actor for a while (I often wondered why Nicholson wrote Head for the Monkees)then he was brought back. I'm more interested in the book when it'son Jn's acting career than personal life though they do intertwine a lot. If you want my opinion this book leaves me with the opinion that Nicholson is a little too clickish in who he works for. Director Bob Raffleson or Diane Keaton or with John and Angelica Huston (before JH died that is) and so on.

4.0,"A Review of:<br />Memories of Gottschee; a Narrated History of Fidelity and Fragility.<br />By Bobbi Thomason. 192 pages, Self-published in 2010.<br /><br />Absent a normal ‘Introduction’, the patient reader must plow through many pages before arriving at the objective of “Memories of Gottschee”.  A glimpse is, however, provided on the back cover: “Thomason traces the history of the Gottscheer in their own words from their childhood in Gottschee to their resettlement in 1941 and their final migration across Europe and the Atlantic Ocean”.<br /><br />The booklet, drawing on interviews of a handful of exiled Gottscheer was written initially to satisfy the requirements of a Master Degree. It subsequently became self-published as a “Narrated History” in 2010. In this oral history, each individual narrative was followed with sympathetic comments, favorable analysis and frequent, often erroneous historical facts, by this ‘insider’ who claims to be a “curious historian” (pg. 178).<br /><br />Interviewed were a sample of 38 persons, all of them having immigrated to the US in the early 1950’s.  Of the 38, only 5 were 16 years or older in 1941, while all others were less than 10 when they, as part of the approximately 12,000 Gottschee-Germans, were coerced (not “forced”) to leave their homeland in which their ancestors lived for over 6 centuries. The destination, according to the author, was the “Deutsches Reich, the German Empire”. (Hitler’s Third Reich was hardly an empire).  Not mentioned is the fact that this was just another part of nearby Slovenia, occupied and annexed by Hitler’s armies in 1941. Hidden is also the fact that the destination was:  the homes and properties of 37,000 Slovene, who were expelled to make room for the arrivals and transported by the SS to labor camps in central Germany. And at the end of the Third Reich in May 1945, the resettled Gottscheer were expelled from Slovenia as part of the Nazi occupier and most eventually immigrated to the US in the1950’s where they congregated and commiserated in “communities”.<br /><br />The author, aged 30 in 2014, with both maternal grandparents born in the former Gottschee, (a miniscule ethnic German enclave in Slovenia) describes herself a loyal member of this “community”, i.e. an ‘Insider’.  Intrigued by the “established narrative of victimization” the author began her research of oral history “aware and skeptical of certain omitted pieces” and that “narrators might not want to discuss certain topics”.  “I did ask uncomfortable questions on National Socialism, German allegiances and wartime traumas” but often “felt torn between the approaches of an investigative reporter, a morally conscious anthropologist, an informed academic [sic] and a respectful granddaughter”.<br /><br />As explained on page 11, one of the four who declined to be interviewed laments: “I can’t lie to you, but I can’t tell you the truth either”.  To an informed reader, this is motivation to read on and discover how the 38, who agreed to be interviewed, avoided “lying” while simultaneously “not telling the truth”.<br /><br />In the final Chapter the author does, summarily, admit:  “Having examined Gottscheer history, specifically since the First World War, and observed how Gottscheers offer or avoid certain stories, it is clear that this community’s memory is selectively constructed.”<br /><br />A reader, informed about historical facts, can conclude that the author avoids challenging the prevalent myth, one that claims -- the Gottscheer Germans were “victims” of Nazi &#34;in-gathering policy&#34; -- while simultaneously denying any participation in its execution. It would, obviously, be highly risky for this ‘Insider’ to disturb the status-quo and challenge this deeply ingrained and self-serving mantra.<br /><br />To emphasize this, the author reports that several have tried, only to bring upon themselves the full wrath of the ‘community’.  One of them whom she does not identify: “… has been described to me as a ‘traitor’, a ‘bully’ and ‘a crazy man’. Ironically, much like Hitler, his is a name that goes unspoken in the community and one that was equally challenging for me to bring up in interviews”. Therefore, “… part of why I am very careful with how I phrase questions is the awareness that I may be perceived in the same way”.<br /><br />With the above, the author admits she is aware of the structure of the myth, but wishes to remain a loyal ‘insider”. She does this by defending ‘victimhood’ while, simultaneously, minimizing ‘cooperation’ with the Nazis in the 1930’s. This ‘insider’ position, however, invites a challenge to both ‘victimhood’ while ‘denial of cooperation’, a challenge based on the writings of serious historians such as the German, Dr. Hans Herman Frensing, William Shirer and many others.<br />  - - - -<br />While the Germans of Germany freely admitted they were both ‘victims’ and ‘cooperators’, they resolutely rejected and cast out the Nazi perpetrators after WWII. The Gottschee Germans, while claiming to be proud of their German heritage, have not followed their brethren in this. Quite to the contrary, the Gottscheer in post-war Associations appointed their own ‘perpetrators’ to “Honored Members and “Cultural Advisers” in their associations which hid their deeds. How this reflects on the credibility of this Gottscheer myth is obvious.<br /><br />In Nazi Germany, the perpetrators were Hitler and his fanatical followers. In Gottschee it was the 25 year old Wilhelm Lampeter, his inner circle, the leaders of his Storm Troopers and the leaders of Richard Lackner’s Hitler Youth. In general, however, it is fair to say that the general population was, at least early-on, divided into enthusiastic supporters, passive followers, doubting observers, and some active opponents.  What is certain, however, most of the Gottscheer population was largely unaware of Hitler’s lethal ideology, but he was admired, at least up to 1941, for being a great German leader.<br /><br />Among the opponents were the Gottscheer priests who called Lampeter and his inner circle “Rotzbuben” (snot boys).  For this they were ostracized, denounced and ridiculed, and attendance of their Sunday Mass blocked by rallies.  Frensing (pg. 86) quotes: “Within the inner leadership, Catholicism is viewed as a Universalistic worldview which must be eradicated”. Other opponents were threatened with Concentration Camps. Lampeter also developed a list of “undesirables” not fit for the Home to the Reich program. This included all mixed marriages, the physically handicapped and other un-trustworthy in general. (Frensing, pg. 83, 84).<br /><br />The shift toward greater support for the resettlement in 1941 was the result of the ever increasing coercive drumbeat and pressure that was applied by the Lampeter leadership and its enthusiastic supporters. This is borne out by the fact that 95 % of the population opted to follow the call “Heim ins Reich” (Home to the Reich).  The often heard lament of the interviewed “we had no choice” contains, therefore, a mountain of ambiguous truths.<br /><br />To accomplish this, these young leaders whipped up hatred for the Slovene whom they described as “Untermenschen” (low level human beings).  They grossly exaggerated the cultural suppression by the Slovene after WWI claiming they denied them their German heritage. Fact is, attempts by the pre 1938 Gottscheer leadership, especially in the 1920’s toward reconciliation with the Slovene were largely successful.  By 1931 there were again 22 private German schools in the enclave. And in 1935, there were 21 public schools in which German classes we held. (Author, pg. 48, 49), However, the official language was Slovene, the language of the State, as is the case in any country, including the US. Teachers were German speaking Slovene and Gottscheer teachers who were competent in Slovene. Those who were not, were given one year to become proficient. If not they were retired and most left for Austria.<br /><br />However, all this was irrelevant to a Reich that wanted useful confrontation with Yugoslavia, Slovenia included. The existing Gottschee leadership, consisting of  Dr. Arko and Rev. Eppich, was forced by the Reich to resign in 1939 and the young leadership under Lampeter, all trained in the Reich, was installed that January 1939 to negate all prior effort toward further reconciliation.<br /><br />In a meeting on April 26, 1941, Hitler personally agreed to Lampeter’s request that he and his leadership be given the responsibility for the resettlement.  And to project authority, Lampeter was promoted to major in the Gestapo SS personally by Himmler.  This is all itemized by Dr. Hans-Hermann Frensing in his “The Resettling of the Gottscheer Germans”. The book was published in 1970, but most of the printing was rapidly bought up by Gottscheer Associations in Germany and Austria to limit distribution.  And when it became known that a Gottschee-American was willing to translate the book into English, the Associations mounted an enormous drive to prevent publication. All this to prevent subverting a myth being so actively promoted by the former ‘perpetrators’.<br /><br />The F&uuml;hrer’s call to resettle home into the Reich, a place where they would be proud Germans again was a difficult order to resist. Even if the order came via his surrogates; sons and daughter who barely outgrew their teenage years and who coerced and lied to their people in order to accomplish Hitler’s wishes (Lampeter was 25 in 1941).  Nevertheless, the resettlement started on November 14, 1941 and was completed on January 23, 1942. During the 73 days, some 11,747 Gottscheer, now citizen of the Third Reich, left their homeland for nothing more than a promise. Of them 571, identified by Lampeter as undesirables, were sent to labor camps in the inner Reich.  (Frensing, pg. 167). Approximately 600 stayed. And barely four and a half years later, in May of 1945, all of the 11,747 in-gathered to the Reich, were homeless refugees, with me at 14 years among them.  Most of us immigrated to the USA.<br />  - - - -<br /><br />Early in 1950, the former Gottscheer leaders (1938-1941) re-assembled in newly established associations in Europe. Richard Lackner, Lampeter’s second in command, head of the Gottscheer Hitler Youth and a voluntary member of the SS, became chairman of the Associations in Germany. And in Austria, Herbert Erker, editor of the Gottscheer Zeitung 1939-1941, again became editor of the GZ, restarted in Austria in 1955. He was followed by Ludwig Kren until 1996. Kren was Assistant Editor under Erker before the move. Lampeter had fled to East Germany (where he became a professor in a Communist University) and out of reach from those investigating war crimes. (During part of the war he was stationed in Buchenwald Concentration Camp. He rejoined the Gottscheer Associations in January 1990 where he was, like the others, made an “Honorary Member” and “Cultural Adviser”). He died in 2003. (Not “2002” as per author).<br /><br />Among the immigrants to the US in the early 1950’s were many who had been supporters of Lampeter and his leadership circle. All had been trained in the Reich during the 1930’s, while Lampeter and his susurrates trained the sympathizers after 1938.  These new arrivals had an easy task of instilling their self-serving perspectives in the un-informed Gottscheer communities in the US, for years since the start of WW II without any news of Gottschee and totally unaware of the 1941 resettlement and its details. Here they joined the long Gottscheer Associations where they quickly became leading members. The main Association was the “Gottscheer Hilfswerk”, the most established association in the US; one that after 1945 was initially fully committed to help the exiled in Europe.  However, by 1966: “the entire board of trustees was composed of recent immigrants”. (Petschauer, pg. 152). Consequently, these new trustees andother like-minded members were actively bonding with associations in Germany and Austria in annual joint policy meetings, thereby securing the myth now taking hold ever since the appearance of the new Gottscheer Zeitung in 1955.<br />The widely read new Zeitung provided great comfort with its mantra not only for post-war immigrants but also for the earlier arrivals who were perplexed over the decision to resettle during a war whose outcome was still uncertain.  The Zeitung, edited by Herbert Erker and later Ludwig Kren, actively promoted the myth of “victimhood” while hiding any “participation” and denying all responsibility for the resettlement, while placing the blame squarely on the Slovene who denied them their German heritage.<br /><br />The Zeitung was again functioning as a propaganda tool, fooling and lying to their people for the second time.  (The original one, the main promoter of Nazi propaganda 1938-1941, had also been widely read in all the villages prior to the resettlement.  In my village of Masern, there were always several copies available in each of the three Gasthouses, each new issue eagerly read by all villagers, thus proving presumptuous the comment of the author: “I can at least conclude its readership was minimal, particularly outside of central Stadt Gottschee”).<br /><br />The recent immigrants (and those who had arrived long ago) found great comfort in this myth. It hid the burden of culpability in their new homeland that had shed so much blood in getting rid of the scourge. “We were victims of the Nazis who forcefully resettled us out of our land” became an evasive reply to those who wanted to hear why. More to say was risky.  “They [the Americans] would think we were Nazis” said the women who refused to be interviewed. She even stopped speaking German. Instead they congregated in get-togethers where they could speak freely and commiserate about their misfortune. And revel in merrymaking and nostalgia about another place at another timewhile perpetuating the myth regarding their history.<br /><br />The Gottschee-Germans, once a minority in a Slavic land and after 1918 devoid of the century’s long cultural protection from Austria, did become victims of Hitler’s ideology, but even more so of his surrogate leaders whose objective was to turn: “love for their Homeland into love of the F&uuml;hrer”. (Frensing, pg. 75.)  That they succeeded in 1941 is evident in the fact that 95 % followed the pipers. As a loyal ‘insider’ the author cannot deny this, but cannot tell the truth either.  However, Matija Pavlitschek, as one of the narrators who stayed, put it to the author: “At the time they were all idealists. They really believed. Or they were lemmings”.  (Author, pg. 60).<br /><br />While the narratives of this handful of “Community” members are of interest in what they reveal and what they hide, it is the commentary of the author that compromises her claim of “having examined Gottscheer History” and being a “curious historian”. Both claims are undermined by quoting faulty references, misstating of relevant details, inaccurate translations, inconsistent and erroneous spelling of names (Gottshee vs. Gottschee) and dates (Hans Kump was born twice in 1924, once on Feb. 4 and again on May 24). It would seem, the Adviser for this Master’s Degree project at this distinguished University was oblivious of trivial [sic] details.<br /><br />The most telling is the claim that “Gottschee was founded in 1330”. This assertion was taken from a paper by Edward Skender, (http://www2.arnes.si/~krsrd1/conference/CVs/Skender_CVeng.htm), who, under the title “Early History of Gottschee–Ko'evje”, writes:<br /><br />“Gottschee itself was probably [sic] founded sometime around 1270. It is first mentioned in records of 1310, [which records, ??] and more definitively in the year 1330, when the archbishop of Aquileia asks the Count of Ortenburg to nominate priests to be pastors for the parishes of Ossiunitz, G&ouml;ttenitz, Gottschee, P&ouml;lland, and Reifnitz. Three of the towns mentioned in the archbishop’s letter -- Ossiunitz/ Osilnice, G&ouml;ttenitz/Gotenice, and Gottschee/Ko'evje -- were in the newly-established domain of Gottschee”.<br /><br />Fact is, the area (not “domain”) was part of the Parish of Reifnitz (Ribnica) and owned by the Counts of Ortenburg, (not “Ortenberg” as spelled by Thomason). Around 1330 it was a place sparsely settled by Slovene, where a central space was called Ho'e; the area around it Ho'evje. (Petschauer, pg. 50). A letter from the Patriarch (not “Archbishop”) of Aquileia, Ludovicius I, dated 1363 (not “1330”), authorized Count Otto VI of Ortenburg (not “Frederick”) to establish new parishes (not “nominate priests”) in the villages, (not “towns”) spelled in the letter as: “Gotsche, P&ouml;lan, Costel, Ossewnitz et Gotenitz”. (Petschauer, pg.39). Here, the name Gotsche, (not “Gottschee”), the German equivalent of Ho'e, appears for the first time.<br /><br />In an earlier letter dated 1339, Bertram the then Patriarch of Aquileia, granted Count Otto VI of Ortenburg’s request for permission to appoint a priest to the chapel of Mahovnik (Mooswald), only 13 km from Ribnica (Reifnitz) just inside the forest. This is the first formal record that settlers, both German and Slovene, were being settled in the forest by the Counts of Ortenburg.<br /><br />Thomason also relies on Skender who states that: “… in the year 1370, the emperor [Chares IV] ‘made available’, 300 families from the area of Franconia and Thuringia in Germany for settlement in Gottschee as noted in a document from the archives of the archbishop [Patriarch] of Aquileia. My guess [??] is that these families were involved in some sort of rebellion …… “.<br /><br />It was Valvasor who first reported on this. He states that he found the information in the diary of Bishop Paul who lived in Ljubljana in the 14th Century. The entry is dated in 1363. (Not “1370”). Thomason’s credibility as a “curious historian” would be less compromised by not quoting amateurs.<br /><br />The author’s claim of “curious historian” suffers both in translation and interpretation of quotes from serious historians such as Frensing and Shirer. The sentence in Frensing’s book (pg. 84) “der Gottscheer Kreisausschu&szlig; der KP Sloweniens” is translated into „the Gottscheer Council of Koper Slovenes“.  No such group existed. A more accurate translation would be “the Gottschee branch of the Communist Party of Slovenia” as is obvious from the text.  Falsely quoted is also Shirer (pg. 74): “the resettlement in the Autumn of 1941 occurred later in the war when Hitler was in a weaker position”. He says no such thing. Fact is, in the autumn of 1941, Hitler was at the peak of his power.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that this, apparently sincere, effort on ”oral history”,  burdened with so much inaccuracy and fiction, adds little, if any, enlightenment to those still struggling to comprehend the true reasons behind the tragic destiny of the Gottschee Germans.<br /><br />John Tschinkel,  August 31, 2015",08/31/2015 0:00,"Memories of Gottschee.

2.0,"I've read the whole SWORD OF TRUTH series three times (as of this writing), including LAW OF NINES and THE FIRST CONFESSOR.  I love Goodkind's work.It was interesting seeing what Goodkind could come up with once the main storyline of THE SWORD OF TRUTH was completed a few years ago.  We got THE OMEN MACHINE, and with that, some idea of where the story could go with new adversary Hannis Arc.  THE THIRD KINGDOM brings this to us in a big way.  Arc has the potential to 'rise up' as a worthwhile villain, but in TTK, ANOTHER baddie is introduced that has the intelligence, cunning, and experience to really complicate Richard and Kahlan's lives for the forseeable future.Technically, Goodkind continues his new writing style which, to these eyes at least, mirrors the approach of James Patterson:  short chapters.  I can only speculate that Goodkind may be doing this to make the reading experience easier for potential readers, or maybe this approach makes it easier for him to put his new stories together.  I really don't know, but either way I like it.  I never minded the longer chapters of his previous books, but even so... while the shorter chapters could be a bit jarring to long time readers, it's not really a big deal.  Another thing... the books are also a lot shorter.  Gone are the days of Goodkind's 1000 page tomes.  I'm not happy about that, but if he can put out a book a year... then that somewhat makes up for it.The story kicks in right away, and we are thrust into the middle of a dangerous situation.  There are many questions to be answered, and for roughly the first half, there is much exposition giving us a LOT of backstory.  We are filled in on the situation going on in the dark lands, and many questions are answered.  There is a lot of action... I never got bored.  There is always something interesting going on.  By the time I got to roughly 75% of the book... the scope of the book quadrupled.  The philosphical heart of the book, IMHO... happens in chapter 27.  My opinion only, but this brought home the themes of the book for me.  After that, it's off to a mini-quest for Richard... one he has no choice about.  There are some interesting new characters:  a young sorceress, some non-loyal Mord Sith, and a new enigmatic BAD GUY.  There are ties to Magda Searus (the first confessor), many references to the original SOT series (natch), even some ties to the LAW OF NINES which I'm really interested in.  There is a lot to keep SOT fans happy.Overall, I think this (if possible) is an improvement in THE OMEN MACHINE in that while that last one opened up a lot of questions without answers, this one answers a lot.  All I can say is... the dark lands are REALLY dark.Highly recommended.  (Thank you, Terry!)I worry about how new readers can find a way into the series without knowing what has come before.  There are many allusions, and this kind of stuff is really rewarding if you have read the whole series... but it could be lost on new readers.  That doesn't detract from the storytelling, but it is a rich addition that is nice to experience.  All I can say is...  buy this one... read it now if you want... but by all means... start reading from the beginning!",08/24/2013 0:00,Return to FORM,5.0

I also found it interesting that when push came to shove, literally and figuratively, he ended up desperately looking for a phone and a car. It seems that the author has a way of justifying to himself when it was or is OK for his family to use technology. The first thing he and his wife did after their baby was born was go to a Kmart. Did I read that right? Pleeeeese. There were no new revelations in this book nor did he back up anything with interesting scientific facts, like how much energy our country uses, how much water we waste or how much garbage, pollution, etc., we create and how his experiment addressed these social problems. I don't think he really cares. What I read was a story about a kind of lazy, full-of-himself guy looking for a way to have more leisure time.

13.0,"Allegiant, you were the biggest disappointment of the year for me. Here I was looking for an epic battle between the Allegiant and the Erudite but instead, what I got was a complete and utter mess. It's taken me days to form some coherent thoughts on the book so here goes...WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADThe problems I had with AllegiantMY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIENow I don't have any problems with going out of the box, and Allegiant was a true mind numbing experience. Instead of giving us the epic, final battle we were looking for, Veronica Roth chose to defer from the whole thing and explain the true reasoning behind the factions. This is how it went...The Bureau of Genetic Warfare: You were all an experiment, and your whole life and everything you know is a lie.Tris and co.: ...Oh okay then.Wouldn't you think that if this happened to you and your friends, there would be denial, breakdowns, refusals and drama? These guys were just stunned, accepting mullets.WHAT MAKES YOU SO PERFECTThe biggest shock to Tris and Co. appear to be some strange form of prejudice, where the Bureau has manufactured the Chicago experiment to box people away into their neat little pigeon holes so they can modify their behaviour based on their genetically damaged (GD) genes. Yes, these are the factions that we know.The reasoning behind this is to absolve the flawed behaviour of these genetically damaged people after the government has unsuccessfully messed around with people's genes resulting in The Purity War, which I'll talk more about below.I don't know about you, but calling someone genetically damaged does not sit right with me. Everyone has flaws and you learn to live together and love one another. If you thought the prejudice of the factions were bad, imagine the disdain that would come from someone's genetic makeup. I can't ever imagine people giving consent to messing with people's genes on a mass scale...Every faction loses something when it gains a virtue: the Dauntless, brave but cruel; the Erudite, intelligent but vain, the Amity, peaceful but passive; the Candor, honest but inconsiderate; the Abnegation, selfless but stifling.FLAWED REASONINGThe Bureau pretty much manufactured the experiments after The Purity War, where those with damaged genes after extensive genetic manipulation had waged a war on the government and those with pure genes. Their primary goal is to ultimately heal people's genes to become the Divergent, recovering from the ultimate fatal flaws of the GD. If this is the case, why did they not equip the Chicago experiment with this knowledge and filter all of the Divergent out of the city, once identified? Why were the Divergent placed under threat from the faction leaders? It makes no sense.LET'S JUST HIT RESETThose Bureau guys just won't learn. It appears that the uprising in Chicago has happened once before in the outer edges of the factionless places. So they administered the memory serum to make everyone forget it ever happened and start over. While it's happening again, and what's their solution? The memory serum again. Just so they can watch their sick reality TV show all over again.Not to mention Tris's plan to wipe the memories of The Bureau, thereby making everything obsolete and pointless. The experiments, the GD war, the serums, everything. Let's stop them from wiping away the memories of our loved ones by wiping away their memories, that will teach them! Last I heard, two wrongs don't make a right.GOODBYE SEXY BROODY FOUR, HELLO MR WHINYWhen Allegiant was announced, we were excited to get inside the mind of the mysterious Four and find out what goes on in his head. What it turns out to be is a constant whining, insecurity, mommy and daddy issues, and a whole lot of angsty emotion. Four in Divergent/Insurgent, was a hunky, confident, mysterious instructor. Four in Allegiant is an annoying, whingy puddly mess. Not only that, but in Allegiant he seems to make all the wrong decisions and not trust Tris repeatedly, even though she was right. Roth must have had a vendetta against him, making his decisions result in Uriah's death, taking away Tris, making him one of the GD.As the book switched perspectives between Tris and Four, it was difficult to pick out who it was throughout the book. The two just sounded so damn similar and their voice was exactly the same.SIDE CHARACTERS - WHO WERE THEY AGAIN?Christina, Uriah, Caleb, Cara and co. were all in this book but the fact of the matter is - you could have taken them away and come up with exactly the same outcome. The only one that seemed to make any impact was Nita, the new rebel girl who has her own illogical ideas. But the whole flirting with disaster thing with Four? Didn't sit well with me. And Caleb of course, who was a sniveling mess of a man living in the shadow of what he did to Tris in the past. There's a man who for his whole early life, urged Tris to be selfless. There's a man who couldn't be selfless himself, when it came down to it.HERE'S AN IDEA - LET'S COMMUNICATE!At the end of the book, there's 4 different plans that went on to stop the overthrowing of the Chicago experiment, that would result in the death of thousands and dare I say - the genetically pure/Divergent. The Bureau would release a mass memory serum and wipe out the memories of the entire city. One group will go in to inoculate their loved ones from the mass memory wipe. The other group will go in, take the death serum and release the memory serum on The Bureau. And Four decides to go against all of this and administer the memory serum to either Evelyn or Marcus to end this thing once and for all. At any one point, they could have told each other what was going on. But nope, never happened. Which is frustrating, seeing as Four's plan could have saved them all.FINALLY...THE DEATH WAS ONLY FOR SYMBOLISM'S SAKEI'm not so cut that Tris died in the first place, after all that is who Tris is, brave and selfless and always putting her loved ones ahead of herself, even if it was for snivelling Caleb who deserves death himself. Tris, in this novel could do no wrong. She was always right, she was selfless, she was genetically pure, she loved and finally sacrificed herself for the good of everyone. That's great, because we love Tris and her journey over the past 3 books have showed her that she's her own person.But my biggest problem was how the author administered the final blow, and then the way she justified it to everyone in her explanatory blog post. Let's have Tris survive a death serum (how is that even possible), have a false sense of survival and then have someone come in a shoot her! That is just cruel. Tris has survived death so many times and she went in because she knew she had a sliver of a chance in surviving. Roth considered having her survive, but didn't, just because she deserved it and that was what she chose:This was the end she had chosen, and I felt she had earned an ending that was as powerful as she was. - RothSymbolism's sake, the ending could have just been powerful in the wake of Tris surviving, but instead it is causing an Erudite/Factionless outrage.OVERALL THOUGHTSI found Allegiant to be disappointing for a myriad of reasons, it was illogical, rendered a book boyfriend completely useless and ripped away what could have been a satisfying ending to an awesome trilogy into something that completely ruined my affinity for the whole series. Veronica Roth took risks, she's Dauntless and gave us something that we couldn't have imagined and that, I do respect. Unfortunately, the end result turned out to be an incoherent mess filled with illogical sequences and a crappy ending.Now does anyone know where I can get myself some memory serum?I received a review copy from Harper Collins Australia in exchange for an honest review.

0.0,From the title readers are trying to understand why the main character is being called a monster. As the book progresses readers find out the events that led to him being behind bars. He tells his story like a movie to cope with being in such a negative place.  His movie includes the court visits to the daily angst from being locked up and his concern with his future.  He does return to life beyond bars.  This book was an interesting look life behind bars and the consequences of a situation that seemed innocent at the time that turned bad.

1.0,"*I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in return for an honest review*<br /><br />War is something that few talk about, at least in terms of the intimate details. The family members I've had in wars never spoke about it other than little details here and there. Never enough to paint a picture of what it was like. That's why I'm so grateful for a book like 'Til We Meet Again' by the Whipps because it not only shows one soldier's time in the war (and a brief gaze into that of a nurse) but how God was with him the whole time. The novel is a wonderful love story, and while it's amazing that Ray and Betty fell in love and had their life together it was really their love of God that spoke through the pages. Their plans didn't turn out the way they has thought but both knew without a doubt that God had a better plan for them. It's a true testimony to God's presence and the power of a relationship with Him.<br /><br />What truly spoke to me was Ray's comfort in the fact that even when he was physically alone, he knew he wasn't. God was with him the entire time. The comfort he felt from scripture was inspiring, and has made my relationship with God that much more precious. No, not everyone came back from the war. Plenty of Christians died, as well. That didn't mean that God wasn't with them. Ray talks about this, wondering about the Germans praying as well.<br /><br />One day while I was waiting for a friend, I was sitting and reading this book. We had picked a central meeting place in downtown, and I looked up and realized I was sitting at the city's cenotaph. Everything hit me then, how God places people and situations into your life at an appointed time. It is clearly the case with Ray and Betty.<br /><br />'Til We Meet Again is a moving story about God's presence, and His Will, and how far our faith can take us. I think even non-believers would appreciate this novel as a true account of the second world war.

At first, I was worried that I wouldn't like this novel as much as the others because it is not told in the style of previous books, with all of the plot and interactions revealed to the reader through emails, text messages, voicemails, letters, notes, etc., that I had come to define as Cabot's personal style. But then I realized that the first Heather Wells' mystery installment could not be told that way and it turns out that I still enjoyed it very much.This novel is instead written in first person and manages to retain Cabot's unique storytelling voice by starting each chapter with lyrics from Wells' tween fame days. Not only does Size 12 retain Cabot's unique storytelling, it also retains that chick lit vibe of being a quick and entertaining read, it has romance, a strong heroine figure with a supporting cast of relatable, quirky and likable characters. The plot is interesting, and has appropriate mystery twists and I personally loved the climax!My only regret about the book is that I wished I knew more about Wells' mother, father, and how those experiences affected her. Although, those characters and events are touched upon in the novel and explained it was not done to my satisfaction. To have such tramuatic events happen to anyone [for example: her mom stealing all of her money and running away]is painful and hard to deal with and I wish I could have known more instead of just the surface facts.Overall, a very enjoyable-up-to-Cabot's-par experience.

While the plot itself is not particularly derivative of that work, it mimics in ways that would be easy to avoid.  Examples can be found in other less favorable reviews, and even they only skim the surface.But the story is what is most important, and so are the characters.  The hero is boringly perfect.  He never makes any mistakes when it counts, and his victories seem forgone conclusions by the end of the book.  The villain, while technically being human, is systematically deprived of any redeeming, human characteristics.  There is no romantic progress between the hero and his woman, because their relationship is serious by the time we meet her and it is never interrupted.

She turns on the television one evening to see her bottom shaking to Beyonce&#8217;s &#8220;Single Ladies&#8221;. Mortified beyond belief, she is shocked to learn that Carrington&#8217;s will be home to a new reality show, Kelly Cooper Come In Store.Shock turns to mortification when she learns that Tom knew all about it and never told her! Georgie fears that instead of being magical, this will be her worst Christmas ever!What Georgie doesn&#8217;t count on, however, is that Christmas is full of magic and a little bit of it might just come her way&#8230;I flat out adore Alexandra Brown&#8217;s Carrington&#8217;s series. The books go beyond the genre of chick lit and make it something more, something deeper. Laugh out loud funny and told with tons of heart, Christmas at Carrington&#8217;s is no exception.Eddie, Sam and the whole Carrington&#8217;s gang is back for me. It&#8217;s a thrill to see them all again. One of Alexandra Brown&#8217;s strength lies in the characters she creates. Georgie  is flat out the best heroine I&#8217;ve read in ages. Brown doesn&#8217;t just write characters, she creates them. You feel as if you know them, even after a few pages.What&#8217;s great about Christmas at Carrington&#8217;s is that the book doesn&#8217;t go anywhere you think it will. The reality show (or as Eddie calls is Dramality) adds a whole new dimension to the book. Georgie is shocked to learn that a lot of the reality tv shows she loves are actually staged and there is the real reality and the one portrayed on the show.I also loved the development in character between Georgie and her father. It was heart breaking but beautiful and tender hearted and it speaks again to Alexandra Brown&#8217;s strength that in one book, she was able to make me laugh out loud and tear up. There is such a range of emotions in Christmas at Carrington&#8217;s and it takes a very skilled author to perfect that balance.I&#8217;ve already read the book twice and will read it for a third time over the Christmas Holidays. What makes Christmas at Carrington&#8217;s (and all of her books) so wonderful is that these are people you care about, people you root for and some that you love to hate. She&#8217;s able to pull you right into the story from page one and you won&#8217;t want to stop reading, anticipating the ending but dreading it at the same time because you never want the book to end.Christmas at Carrington&#8217;s is a fantastic, wonderful, magical read. I for one, can&#8217;t wait to read it again. Do yourself a favour and treat yourself to an early Christmas present. One that you&#8217;ll want to read again and again.Will Georgie get a happily ever after for Christmas? You&#8217;ll just have to read it yourself and find out!",11/26/2013 0:00,A Magical Christmas!,5.0

5.0,"This book was a pleasure to read and rang that tuning fork deep in my soul. Told against the backdrop of the rugged beauty of a Louisiana most of us will never know, at a time when the American dream was there for the taking, this is a starkly honest story about that most complex of all relationships, the one men have with their fathers, and the process of how that relationship must inevitably unfold. While the narrative of a larger than life dad and the dramatic arc of his life is not unique, Blaine Lourd reminds us with a mix of elegant prose, humor and humility of the truth that we all grow up to know: as boys we cast our fathers as heroes and in turn they project all their hopes and dreams on to us, hoping that somehow we will grow up to be the unsullied version of them - avoiding their mistakes and therefore their regrets. As a young dad I already feel the pull of that cycle from the other side and Lourd makes me wonder if it's not better to embrace it than try to avoid it.",08/31/2015 0:00,As a young dad I already feel the pull of that cycle from the other side and Lourd makes me wonder if it's not better to embrace,5.0

2.0,"Marian Keyes has a knack for knowing what women want to read and writing it with sass and spunk.  This book was at times heartbreaking and heartwarming with a generous dash of humor sprinkled throughout.  But what is more, the characters are so fun and so well scripted that the reader can sympathize with any and all of them, which makes for a truly engaging read.Claire Webster has been dumped, in the worst sense of the word.  Just hours after going through agony (the worst PMS you've ever had, times a thousand, thank you very much) and giving birth to a perfect baby girl, her husband James informs her briskly that he is having an affair and he is leaving.  When suddenly her life comes crashing down around her, what's a girl to do?  Go home...to Dublin!Unfortunately, home comes equipped with two neurotic sisters (one chemically induced) and two well meaning, if sometimes inappropriate, parents.  Upon returning to Ireland, Claire goes through a phase of utter despair, involving maximum alcohol and minimal bathing.  Thankfully, with the help and encouragement of her family, Claire pulls through and begins taking care of herself and her beautiful baby girl.  It is around this point that a gorgeous man named Adam breezes into the family abode.A tumultuous and whirlwind emotional encounter between the three (Claire, Adam, and baby Kate) ensues, utterly drawing the reader in.  Amidst all this, Claire's estranged husband James reenters her life, letting her know in no uncertain terms that his affair is over and it is time for her to come back home.  This turmoil between duty, passion, and love creates a wrenching peak of the book, one that will have readers fuming, crying, and perhaps laughing a little.With her usual sense of style, Marian Keyes creates a wacky world of family love and creates in her heroine a strong and utterly believable woman.  All the characters help draw the audience into the story, but the plot is what keeps them turning the pages.  I adored this book and read it in one sitting, and it was one of those books that made me smile and made me cry.

,"The book is a very entertaining read and as you read it, most everything written comes off as genuine, but... as you get towards the end of the book and have read about all the manipulation that has gone on in the community, you get the feeling that their is a veiled hidden agenda and some embellishment in the book, that and style left out a lot stories of pickup failures.While many of the events did happen in the book, your instincts go off and feel the book is setup to give you a high and as a base for neil to market the pickup industries material to desperate guys.  (i.e. Neils, Mysteries, Ross Jeffries, etc) In fact Strauss has started his own pickup business and is charging astronomical (~$4000) amounts of money for a set of DVD's.  It's insane, these guys are getting rich off simply being popular and taking advantage desperate guys.  Also the book gives the illusion that their pickup techniques are so effective they work on anyone, anywhere, this is total bs.In reading it you really don't get the feeling that Style (the author) was in fact as nerdy as he claims to have been.  I'm sure he was no doubt at one time but there when reading the book he has an uncanny eye for social interaction, you can't be that socially inept and suddenly go to that kind of level of social guru even with training IMHO unless you have natural talent.  Next I've seen mystery and he is not in anyway an ugly guy, he's no model but he is certainly above average looking, period, next he seems like he was a natural conversationalist anyway, I've seen his material.The book has a lot of good points but after reading it you feel like the book almost comes off \too smooth\"" and it ends rather strangely",," most guys are happier when they have women or know they have the ability to attract women in their lives.Lastly the bits about Mysteries \""depressions\""",

I would simply ask that prospective readers attend to his -arguments- rather than his conclusions before deciding on the book.  To do otherwise is  prejudicial, in the original, basic sense of the word. Personally, I think  Behe's argument is sound.  Whether or not you agree, I hope you will find,  as I did, that his argument rests on very concrete, specific, detailed  discussion of what actually happens, and not armchair abstractions of what  one may &quot;suppose&quot; is the case.  I found his style quite  accessible to me, one not trained in the experimental sciences, and indeed  helpful that he offered clever and amusing analogies to the technical  details before discussing them.  I have to confess, too, that I enjoyed the  increasingly trenchant tone later in the book, though I can certainly see  why readers disinclined to his position might be irked thereby.  At any  rate, I have a -greatly- deepened appreciation for biology and biological  processes, and I even wish I knew more about these subjects.",12/24/1998 0:00,Concrete and detailed; not to be judged before reading.,5.0

0.0,"I don't know why it took me so long to read this novel. I had read some of her stories and really enjoyed them, but maybe it was because I saw part of the movie from the novel and just couldn't get into it. The book is different.Sometimes when I read novels with various points of view I find it a bit trite and not really useful. In this book I enjoyed getting the background on the main character, Gogol, through the story of his parents. The novel builds on the lives of the young Indian parents, goes on to describe their American-born children's lives through Gogol's eyes, and continues to follow him through adulthood and loss. Perhaps one point of view jump to his girlfriend wasn't really necessary, but I didn't hate it.The novel reads like a nuanced family history, although it is mostly about Gogol, the Indian immigrant culture that shapes him, and his rebellion against all that. Anyone who has lived a certain number of years--whether they are children of immigrants or not--can empathize with the feelings of resistance against our parents that eventually, with time, morph into longing for the things that remind us of our parents.I find Lahiri's writing clear and clean; flawless. She doesn't use a lot of trickery, and the simplicity is comforting and pleasurable. Reading this novel was like going on a smooth boat ride on placid waters. This is not to suggest it was boring--just that I never felt irritated or troubled by the writing.",02/19/2014 0:00,"Clean writing, real feeling",5.0

The fast paced action and interesting characters kept me reading at a feverish pace.With a lull in my reading last month I was looking for a new author to read.  I read the inside flap of the latest James Grippando book, BEYOND SUSPICION, and I was hooked. The second book in the Jack Swyteck series (THE PARDON being the first), BEYOND SUSPICION starts out with Jack defending his ex-girlfriend, Jessie Merrill, in a case worth 1.5 million dollars.  He wins the case and soon after Jessie ends up dead, in Jack's own bathroom.  Suddenly Jack Swyteck is the prime suspect in her death.  Jack teams up with Theo Knight to attempt to uncover the details around the death of Jessie Merrill and the action kicks in.More than just a legal thriller this book has some great story lines.  Jack's wife Cindy Swyteck is having nightmares from her troubled past.  She is my favorite character in the whole book.  I felt the author did a wonderful job creating the tension around Cindy.  She is dealing with the fact that Jack is the suspect in the death of his own ex-girlfriend, her troubled back-story with Esteban, and her past coming to her in dreams.  All of which are sewn together seamlessly.There are some other good characters that play integral parts as well.  Yuri, a ruthless thug, and Katrina an insider who has her own demons to deal with, are two of my favorites.If you're looking for a new book to read I suggest you pick up BEYOND SUSPICION.  It brings a diabolical mystery, wonderful side stories, face paced action, and a twist at the end that will leave you wanting more!

,"I am a moderate Democrat, 66, who disagrees with a lot of the opinions of Mr. Thomas since he took his seat with the Supremes. Back about 20 years ago, when his confirmation was almost sunk by Anita Hill's charges of inappropriate sexual comments in the workplace, I figured she was being truthful, and he was fibbing. However, even then, what she alleged he DID hadn't seemed to me enough to disqualify him. As I recall, there were no allegations of sexual touching between them. The behavior she objected to years later, when revealing it could make her famous, at least to me fell into the category of boorishness but not malice. But he survived her, and I think the passing years have been kinder to Mr. Thomas than to Ms. Hill. I began to soften towards him about ten years ago, when C-Span televised a talk he gave to school pupils. He was persuasive and impressive on that occasion. The friend who passed his book on to me is much closer to the justice's political and social positions than I am, and yet I liked his book better than my friend. I think Mr. Thomas was pretty hard on himself within its pages, and that impressed me. And his continued denial of everything alleged by Ms. Hill seems more plausible in print than it did in testimony.

2.0,"In 1920-21 America experienced the largest insurrection since the Civil War. The coal fields of West Virginia were the setting for a violent and bitter struggle by the miners and their families against the operators and owners, aided by private armies backed finally by the US Army and president Harding. The conflict culminated in the Battle of Blair Mountain.<br /><br />Denise Giardina recounts that time in this passionate novel.<br /><br />She begins in the late 19th century when first the railways then the mines break up the mountain communities. Farms are lost and once independent men, and their children, have to go underground to make a living. Labour is brought in from all over – black workers from the South, Italian immigrants from across the seas. The appalling conditions are well described. The owners control all aspects of life – homes and shops and amenities are in company towns . Resistance follows – particularly the fight to build a union.  Denise gives an insight too into the role of family and religion and ethnicity in lives of struggle and resistance. The events are narrated by a small cast of characters, centred on the redoubtable Carrie Bishop.<br /><br />This is not a subject I knew about. Storming Heaven has sent me to the few histories that I could find.<br /><br />The novel is also a story of passion in a more conventional sense.  The central character is the redoubtable Carrie Bishop. Carrie’s heart fights its own battle for the love of the belligerent and independent union organizer, consoled by the security offered by the tender and kindly preacher man.<br /><br />I found it great to read a novel about ordinary people living heroic lives.",08/31/2015 0:00,Building Unions,5.0
,"Simon Winchester has written many good books.  This is not one of them.This is the fourth book by him I have read and it is by far the worst.  His attempt to describe what happened in San Francisco in 1906 is long on non-connected rambling facts and short on a story.  The first 175 pages are spent describing plate tectonics and his own personal travels across the US and the world.  What is meant to be an informative introduction into the science of Geology turns into a poorly organized, unnecessarily long rambling with little connection to the story.  The book is replete with single appearances of characters and events which have no barring on what happened in 1906, and whose only purpose is to show how much Mr. Winchester knows.  This is a major problem which will will plague the book - a lack of focus.This book was written without a unifying theme or subject, which is odd, since a very obviously subject exists:  The City of San Francisco.  Mr. Winchester instead makes himself the center of the story and focuses on his own journey rather than the events of 1906.  At page 175, Mr. Winchester finally starts talking about the character and spirt of the city, and we see glimpses of a story being pulled together, only to let it slip away about 50 pages later.  The 80 page chapter on the earthquake and fire was a compilation of 40 different stories that had no connection, except for their physical connection on the page.The worst part of the book is unfortunately not the ramblings with copious footnotes and references, but Mr. Winchester's selective conclusions and commentary.  On page 302 he claims the fire caused San Francisco to lose its dominance on the West Coast after the disaster of 1906 and \the city never regained its status",,as it did in 1849,

From the South Korean government's direct involvement in promoting K-pop (no, I'm not joking) now vs. the de facto total ban on rock music from 1972 to '79 (again, not kidding). That's just the start.

5.0,"Mr. Friedman, an eminent biblical scholar whose works have helped 'unmask' god and explain the method by which the Torah was assembled has failed here in his commentary.  The Torah, oft commented on but rarely successfully explained, is not illuminated here and in fact many of the 'asides' and 'comments' seem far to laid back and far to unprofessional to really meet the muster required of a biblical commentary carrying any weight.  such lines as 'the holiest of holies' take away and transport the reader into popular history, from which the reader never emerges.  A biblical commentary should be of the highest most professional nature and its points should be clear, but this edition skips over essential debates due to the authors disinterest or, perhaps, ill knowledge.  For instance the 'Rape of Dina' is totally glossed over and none of its ramifications are illuminated.  Why was Dina Raped and what was gods judgment on the vengeance?  Did Dina love the prince of Shachem?  This commentary does the bare minimum although it seems to spend more time on other items, for instance the Dietary Laws.  This is by far one of the least impressive commentaries that can be found on the Torah, far better ones can be found, unless you value the laid back nature of it, then you will be happily pleased.",01/26/2004 0:00,Not impressed,4.0

12.0,"TIES THAT BIND is a vehicle for Phillip Margolin's reintroduction of Amanda Jaffe, last seen in WILD JUSTICE. Jaffe is still adversely affected by the events that befell her in that novel and is making efforts to deal with them. Daniel Ames from THE ASSOCIATE also makes a cameo appearance, but this is primarily Jaffe's book. Jaffe is an interesting character, but in TIES THAT BIND, she tends to get lost among the more interesting people and events around her.There aren't a lot of sympathetic characters in TIES THAT BIND. The bad guys are really bad and as is often the case, they're more interesting than the white hats. Jon Dupre, a violent pimp accused of murdering Senator Harold Travis, is a world-class scumbag. It's difficult to let your sense of justice rise to the occasion and see him acquitted of a crime for which he might be wrongfully accused. However, the evidence against him looks strong and, while in police custody, he kills his court-appointed attorney. To paraphrase Tom Sawyer's Aunt Polly, he wouldn't miss a lick if he rode the lightning, even if it was for the wrong crime.There accordingly isn't a lot of tension for any sort of race against time to find the real killer. On top of that, Travis is an extortionist and a murderer in his own right, so his death is not going to elicit any particular sympathy, one way or the other. When Jaffe is requested by the court to take over his defense, it looks like an uphill battle for her. When she begins to investigate Dupre's alibi and claims of innocence, however, she is pressured --- violently --- to drop her investigation and let justice take its course. What is interesting here is what the investigation ultimately uncovers, which is a conspiracy that has existed for decades and that links Travis to a mysterious group of public officials and drug lords. As Jaffe nears the surprising truth, she brings danger closer to herself and those she loves, even as the truth that she and her client is seeking comes from a totally unexpected source.Margolin's plot doesn't always hang together perfectly. The method by which the surprise ending is effected, in particular, is somewhat of a stretch and requires some suspension of disbelief, though it is ultimately quite satisfying. Overall, Margolin remains an exciting writer of great economy with the ability to keep readers turning pages as fast as they are capable of reading. TIES THAT BIND ultimately continues Margolin's unbroken string of riveting, spellbinding novels that are almost impossible to put down without finishing.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub",03/15/2003 0:00,"Margolin has written another page turner, despite some flaws",3.0

3.0,"With A Dance with Dragons, the 5th novel of A Song of Ice and Fire, there is a sense that George R.R. Martin has instilled a few too many plotlines. As there are so many characters doing so many things, it makes me wonder if the story will ever be wrapped up in my lifetime. Despite this fact, I still finished A Dance with Dragons with more of a positive outlook than others might. I'd also like to point out that I was spoiled before I read this book, so whatever preconceptions or hopes I had were quickly washed away before I read even the first pages. As such, I feel like I was able to enjoy it for what it was.After killing his father in cold blood, Tyrion has left King's Landing to go east in search for Daenerys Targaryen. The talk is she is in Meereen preparing her army and growing her dragons in order to invade Westeros. As Tyrion makes his journey, he also goes through his own personal growth as he must cope with his killing of Tywin and Shae. Daenerys is having her own troubles controlling Meereen. Many different forces seem to be conspiring against her, and her rule is on the verge of being overturned. She is having to watch herself in everything she does. One wrong move, and she is done for. Meanwhile up north, Jon Snow is having a tough time getting the Night's Watch to accept the Wildings past the Wall, not to mention Stannis and Melisandre are both there as an added threat. Other plots emerge from Bran as he continues his journey north of the Wall, from Reek trying to find out what his name in his past life was, and from Arya who continues her own training to become an assassin. Of course there are several other point of view characters, as is GRRM's way.Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon are the three that push this narrative forward. They each go through their own transformations. Tyrion never really seemed like himself this time around, but I can let that past as I didn't really expect him to be his jolly 'ol self after killing two people he knew quite well (or, at least, thought so). Dany and Jon both learn that ruling over a lot of people isn't quite what it seems, and everything they decide to do just wouldn't work. Both of them are really put through the ringer as they fail time and time again. Martin definately understands the concept of having your characters fail before they succeed. On another note, the couple of chapters from Bran were just downright beautifully written. Martin was at his best in writing these; I just wish there had been more of it.Despite all this, A Dance with Dragons is still really faulty. The first half of the novel was slow in building up its tension, and the second half seemed to have no narrative coherence. Chapters appear from characters like Jaime and Cersei without really accomplishing anything. And while there isn't an anti-climax in regards to the internal struggles, any fights or battles that might be expected never happened. There's a sense that Martin dug himself into a hole, and while I believe he has found his way out, there was no way that he was going to get out in just a novel's time. For a while I've been wondering if anything could have been done to the structure of A Dance with Dragons to give it a more satisfactory ending, but I really couldn't figure out anything that would work. The cliffhanger in Winterfell is well used, in my opinion, and wouldn't change that. It is the cliffhanger in Meereen, though, that I wish could have been better resolved. Unfortunately, I think it is quite obvious that Battle of Meereen would simply be too long. I can honestly see it taking up half of the next book.(Hopefully Martin decides to showcase the battle without pausing to go elsewhere. It would make for an exciting few hundred pages to see him go through the four or so point of view characters and no one else.)Through all its faults, I still liked the book. I thought it was entertaining, though not on the level of A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, or A Storm of Swords. I am remaining optimistic and feel confident that Martin has figured out the Meereenese knot and, as such, will get The Winds of Winter out in the next two years. He has a lot of work to do, though, with all these different characters. It's about time he kills off a few of them (and keeps them dead).I'm not sure people will enjoy A Dance with Dragons. It is a lot of build up but not much else. I enjoyed it for what it is -- another piece of a very long story. Very long.3.5/5",07/21/2012 0:00,"GRRM Overreaches, but Still Quite Good",4.0

1.0,"It has been quite a while since I have read and reported on an adult book, but for some reason this one caught my eye in the bookstore.Sonea has grown up in the slums of Kyralia where she's developed, among other things, a great fear and dislike of the Magician's Guild. The Guild, as the dwells (the lower class) see it, are dangerous and greedy, pushing them around and only using their abilities for helping the rich. They know, above all else, to steer clear of magicians. Which wouldn't be too difficult, except that Sonea has magic too, strong, untrained magic that the Guild has discovered and cannot let go uncontrolled.A part of me felt like this book (the first one in a trilogy) took too long to get going. There was too much running and hiding from the Guild and not enough actual magic, for my taste. Not that the story was bad, it just felt a bit redundant. But, being a series involving magic and lessons, it ultimately held my attention despite the meandering start.I don't think the different characters were as well developed as they could have been and I disliked the fact that a number of them seemed to disappear halfway through the book. We got to know some people and then never saw them again, which is frustrating and even a bit disappointing.But what the book lacked in character, it made up for in world and plot twist. While it seemed like more could have been happening, there were certainly a handful of unexpected events and what was a set up for a great overall series.

0.0,"The book reads like a blog. There is a lot of really good information that is sandwiched between irrelevant or unnecessary information. For example, Chapter 2 of his book contains an unnecessarily long passage about batteries for cameras. Obviously, this information was factually correct but it seemed highly unnecessary. If a forensic investigator or student needed this oddly detailed information about batteries, he or she may need to change professions. He also references website content, which I find to be in poor taste because that content may not always be there. Sometimes he anecdotal references conversations he has had at conventions, in the classroom, and in the field, which is nice for a blog or lecture but I feel that it is out of place in a textbook.<br /><br />He also discusses areas he would like to change forensic education. I do understand his concern and he is definitely right about how there is a really good possibility in seeing disturbing content on people's hard drives. It is a good topic to discuss but this book shouldn't be the place for it, or minimally not in the middle of the book. These random topic discussions are interspersed throughout the book and makes the book seem like he is rambling in multiple directions.<br /><br />Ultimately I rated this book a 2 because it lacked direction. There is good content, but it could have been delivered more succinctly.",08/27/2015 0:00,Verbose,2.0

3.0,"This story is told through the internal voices of a mother and her children as they are conscripted by the head-of-the-family to go on a religious mission to Africa.Each of the family members into whose minds we enter has a somewhat distinctive voice. But they all are strangely literate voices, down to the youngster in the family, hardly more than a toddler. So they all immediately strike the reader as different shades of the author's mind. This sort of ubiquitous autobiography is almost impossible for a fiction writer to avoid. But in this case, such self-centeredness comes off as a virtue. A reader can soak in the polished thoughts of an author of superb intelligence, soak in the words - such words as never seem to come out of the everyday people one meets in real life. So this book can be read as pure pleasure, as an escape into a salon of fine minds. In that sense, it really is fiction. But it can also be read as pure pain - as a factual account of the crushing problems experienced by all the people of the Congo in the throes of colonial rule.This is a wonderful, memorable book. There is only one drawback to reading it; and it has only one flaw in its writing.The drawback is that it plays into the mounting pessimism about Africa's plight. Many African-American leaders in particular object to the current representation of the Continent simply as a place of problems. And this book can only increase that sense of Africa as being an irredeemable, almost cursed land. There is ultimately no celebration of African culture here - no sense of the possibility of triumph. Africa is experienced as an all-downhill experience along a slide of megalomaniacal leaders, of dangerous beasts, of nature's adversity in the form of alternate droughts and mudslides. Perhaps as a result of this depiction of unrelieved misery, Kingsolver might perpetuate a sort of racism, when surely it is her intention to do just the opposite - to show how humankind is welded together by universal tragedy.The one flaw in the writing of the book is that the father in the family is given no voice. We do not hear his inner reflection and philosophizing. We do not get an insight into his motives. He comes off only as viewed and judged by others - as a religious fanatic who impresses the rest of his family into service to his vision. And it is so easy, almost inevitable, to make the one who is not known, the one in whose shoes we do not walk - the villain of the piece. If to know all is to forgive all, it is the father who is the most unforgiven here, and he therefore becomes the biggest victim of the story. So for all her command of the English language and all her ability to find the right phrase for every nuance of sentiment, Kingsolver perhaps arrives at a second unintended consequence.However this is still a very good book.",06/17/2007 0:00,Reading a Master Mind-Writer,4.0

0.0,"Jesus loved to tell stories to people and people loved to listen to them until some people turned away because what He offered they didn’t accept.  Now, centuries earlier, God did an amazing work when He took the Jewish people from captivity to a land they were to conquer and thrive in.  If you have ever read about the Exodus or seen the many versions of movies based on this historical event, then you are familiar with that story.<br />Sonya Contreras utilizes storytelling, an historical event and a Biblical account to give us a novel that takes the reader back in time to the ancient world.  What made this novel different for me was the heart of the author and the unique approach to what we read in Exodus 1-15.  The novel doesn’t cover everything in the passage as it’s the first book in the series with a second book in the works titled, I Have Called You By Name.<br />The one aspect of the novel that I most appreciated was pointing out that the plagues were to show the false gods versus The One True God.  It was an epic battle for the hearts and souls of those God would call His own against the false gods who weren’t gods at all.  The story shows how through the plagues various characters either realized they were worshipping a false god or some would choose to fight against the God of the Hebrew people.<br />What I also enjoyed was how the author showed how some of the Hebrew people were struggling with following The One True God.  Throughout the book I was enthralled with the drama between Moses and Pharaoh, and eventually how Pharaoh was eventually revealed to the people as nothing but a mortal man, belying their belief in his deity.<br />When you read the list of sources the author used, you get a glimpse into her heart to see a woman who believes wholeheartedly in God and via stories tells the world about Him.  The novel will help readers in understanding how each plague was directly correlated with a specific god or gods that was believed to have power and how God totally and unequivocally shredded these false deities.  I appreciate the author’s work, research and her heart to tell the world a story that captures the heart and engages the mind!  I look forward to her second book whenever it’s released and I plan to read it!and how God totally and unequivocally shredded these false deities.

Peak is like any other boy, aside from the fact that he loves to climb.<br />Peak’s parents are divorced. He never really knew his father until he gets arrested for trying to climb a skyscraper. Peak’s father came to his trial, where the judge ordered Peak to go with his father to Thailand, until the publicity of his arrest subsided.  Once on the plane, Peak realizes they aren’t going to Thailand at all. Peak father was taking him to climb Mount Everest. Peak’s father’s company needed more business, so to get more publicity; he selfishly tries to make Peak become the youngest person ever to climb Mount Everest. Peak starts to climb up Mount Everest; when climbing, he catches a disease that has spread through the camp. Being sick made it harder for him to climb, but it also helps him realize that he will have to focus all of his energy on his climbing, in order to reach the top of the mountain.  When he finally makes it to the summit he has to make a decision that will change not only his life, but the lives of many others.<br />Peak Marcello – brave and adventurous, smart but careless.

,"I will not write a full synopsis of this novel since there is one written by the Amazon reviewer. This is basically the story of Hannah Musgrave, an American woman who comes of age in the 1960s and gets involved in the counterculture. She has to flee to Africa to avoid a federal indictment and gets involved in the turbulent politics of Liberia while also becoming attached to the chimpanzees she encounters in a research lab where she works.It is true that it is a little difficult to sympathize with Hannah and it is clear that she is confused and throughout her life she is searching for her identity. She is also trying to determine where she belongs, which country is hers. She seems to have a problem of being too detached from those who are close to her. Yet she is strong-willed, very independent and idealistic, perhaps, to a fault.Russell Banks writes wonderful prose and the passages dealing with Hannah's farm in the beginning are quite absorbing. There is just one slightly slow portion when Hannah takes road trip in Liberia to meet her potential in-laws. But apart from that the book moves quite fluidly. The story moves quickly in the second half of the book and the final 15-20 pages are quite dark and thought provoking.This was the first book I've read by this author. I had seen the film adaptation of \The Sweet Hereafter\"" which I thought was quite interesting",,1,

,"The Man in the White SuitI have been an avid fan of Top Gear since I first saw an episode a few years ago. Fifth Gear, albeit a similar program, was never quite as entertaining as Top Gear mainly because of the chemistry between the presenters and because Top Gear is more focused on entertainment. Ben Collins' book is not just an autobiography, but also a behind the scenes look at Top Gear. As I suspected, Top Gear is more about entertaining the audience than a factual car review show. Ben Collins revealed that a lot of the driving sequences, such as the Corvette and Fiesta duel in the mall, was mainly action sequences taken in piece meal with the presenter driving sequences cut/pasted into the whole affair to make them look good.

Max is on escorting his wonderfully cantankerous Tata Natasha to a House Party when his coaches are stopped by a band of thieves in the woods.  Max is not one to back down to anyone, especially this raggedy group of outlaws but he is thrown by their leader: a woman wearing a hood and wielding a rapier.<br />Lady Murian has been cheated out of her home and is now the leader and provider of the group of people that had served her and her late husband.  She is determined to lead this band of ‘merry widows’, one Will Scarlae and a giant by the name of Ian out of poverty and back to their rightful home.<br />This is a fun, fun read that I would have finished in one sitting had I not had kids to pick up from school!  The play on the Robin Hood tale is wonderful and lends a nostalgic twist to this romance involving another Oxenburg Prince.  Max may not be the one in the hood, but he definitely rides in to the rescue, quickly seeing through the disguises and being smart enough to realize that there is more in play than just a group of people taking from the rich.  He is a soldier through and through and will take on Murian’s fight as one of his own and work to bring her people back home.  Falling in love Murian, however, may be one battle he’s not willing to fight.  Murian is just as devoted to her ‘family’ and though she’s willing to work harder than anyone to provide warm shelter and food for them; she doesn’t see a life where she does not stay with her people.<br />I loved both of these characters!

To punish her, he hooks up with her sister Glenda, gets Glenda hooked on drugs, destroys her marriage and causes her death.

,"Will Lee, Democratic Senator from Georgia, is planning on running for the presidency in 4 or 8 years, but is convinced by the current Vice President, Joe Adams, to start his campaign immediately even though he feels unprepared to make the move at this time. Adams has confided a dangerous secret to Will, one which has convinced Will to pursue his campaign. The path to the White House is dangerous and fraught with more pitfalls than Will and Kate, his devoted wife who is a deputy director in the CIA, ever imagined.Will is threatened with bad PR from a convicted murderer who claimed that Will was incompetent when he represented him nearly 10 years ago. Will is also threatened with a sexual scandal for a brief liaison with a movie star years ago; and to place him in even more jeopardy, he is the target of a remote militia group assassin, for no apparent reason other than he is a politician.Woods does a masterful job of building suspense and weaving together various sub-plots. The short chapters are well-paced, and move effortlessly between the different scenes and sub-plots. However, some of the sub-plots are never resolved and are left dangling. What happened to Ed Rawls in the Atlanta State Penitentiary who seems to have mysterious powers over politicians and former CIA colleagues? Some topics and plot elements are introduced and then dropped, which leaves you with an incomplete feeling by the end of the novel. After weaving a complicated and intriguing plot, the writer seems to lose interest in some of the characters and just drops them.  In spite of these loose ends, \The Run\"" was a quick",,0,

It is a fantastic series of readable reference books that explores the title topics in varying depths so everyone under the level of Expert gets whole lot out of the books.

,"... at this phenomenon all around me. And that is one of the strengths of Sharlet's book; he was willing to, at length, and in a fairly systematic way.  The American news is filled with the threats and dangers of Islamic fundamentalism (and indeed, there really is such a thing), but what of the Christian religious fundamentalism within our own country, which is usually not discussed in terms of being a threat, but rather as an occasional oddity, such as a theme park that shows dinosaurs and man coexisting, all after 4004 B.C or the numerous televangelists and/or evangelical preachers caught in a sex scandal.

,"I've been reading the Year's Best anthologies for about five years, and have usually found them to be an invaluable resource in keeping up with the short science fiction form.  Although by their very nature, these kinds of anthologies are almost always a mixed bag, I'd always found interesting, well-written and thought-provoking stories in each of them.  In last year's edition the pickings were a little slim, but this year is probably the last time I'll bother with this series.Most of the stories in this anthology are not much more than fine attempts.  While some of them featured good writing and others fine ideas, none displayed all qualities or managed to keep me emotionally involved.  There are a few standouts, but even they would only be considered fairly good when grading outside the covers of this book.  Geoff Ryman's \Birth Days\""",,usually so dependably good,

0.0,"Everyone interested in classic literature knows the basic idea behind &#34;Don Quixote&#34;: an ordinary man, deluded by books of chivalry and romance, goes out to fight whatever great battles he can find on behalf of justice, innocence, virtue, and the oppressed.  There are many, many comic episodes involving &#34;The Knight of the Sorry Face&#34; (Don Quixote) and his squire, Sancho Panza, but if you read only excerpts, you're likely not to realize how masterful a story-teller Cervantes is above and beyond his tale of Don Quixote.  Throughout the book there are subplots and digressive stories that demonstrate Cervantes's ability to tell a typical romance, betrayal, or revenge story with an elegance that makes it a page turner, like the episodes with Don Quixote himself, which seem, paradoxically, a return to &#34;reality&#34; when the idealized stories about idealized characters in their idealized romantic adventures are finished.",06/18/2014 0:00,Master story-teller,5.0

This book allows you to achieve it through twelve practical, hands-on lessons that are based on scripture.  This devotional appeals to both adults and children. I especially love how the authors break each lesson into four sections and suggest a timeline to complete each lesson over the course of a week. The &#34;Give It&#34; portion of each lesson requires completion of hands-on activities that appeals greatly to children and that brings the lessons to life.

,"The \kind\"" of war the author writes of reminds this reader a good deal of the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is a lot of analysis here of the lack of preparedness in both the US military and it's civil government for the limited war aims that would eventually be settled upon in Korea. The author does a good job of mixing in more personal and focused accounts with the bigger picture. The POW experience for both sides is dealt with in some depth also. The chief fault of this book in my opinion was the repetative use of \""pet\"" phrases and cliches. Military men should find this book highly engaging.

0.0,"When I Pray, What Does God Do? by David Wilkinson is a book where the author explains his thoughts on prayer. He not only explains to us what God does do when we pray, but he shows us where to find the information in the Bible, thus allowing us to dig deeper if we so choose. The beginning of this book certainly caught my attention, after all who of us doesn't struggle at some point in our prayer life, and Mr. Wilkinson shares his story, in a very easy to relate to manner. I also enjoyed the many scripture references peppered through out the book, because I always enjoy looking up any scripture pertaining to whatever I am reading. The thing that bogged me down a bit was the scientific aspects which became what I consider dry reading. Overall the personal stories and antidotes balance out the drier aspects, and really had me thinking about what I really know about prayer.
